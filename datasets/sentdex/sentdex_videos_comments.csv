A $2000 laptop is something I could have bought anyway for my main recent model laptop.  And now I can train deep learning models on it using PyTorch and Tensorflow GPU libraries.  2x speed increase over the free Google Colab GPU was an unexpected icing on top.  Asus ROG Strix G17 is a very nice laptop for general use.  (I don’t play games, but have watched movies on it).  Jennifer :-D.', 'Thanks!  I bought the hard cover book nnfs. Didn’t know about it before.  A month ago I bought Asus ROG Strix G17 2021 model for $2000 (MSRP was $1800 at launch, but availability was always limited).  It has NVIDA RTX 3070 gpu with 8 GB video RAM, 16GB regular RAM, Ryzen 9 cpu, and 1 TB SSD.  It was the sweet spot among all Nvidia gpu laptops I reviewed.  $2000 was my budget.  3080 gpu starts having heat issues that reduce how much performance bump you get.  This one does really well with cooling fans.  I used free Google Colab before, and language model epoch speed is twice as fast on this laptop.  I get frustrated using only Colab all the time.  Data has to be downloaded/uploaded to Colab servers each time I run a notebook, only one notebook can be connected at a time, so all code snippets need to fit in one notebook, and there are frequent outages.  Mounting large dataset to Google Drive really slows down processing, so is not an option for deep learning.  I am so happy I bought a gpu laptop.  I will use it for tweaking and pilot testing, then run the really large models on paid cloud services.  It’s very convenient having the conda environment set up just the way I want, and Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 and Ubuntu set up the way I like too.  Thank you for your years of teaching online.

These are made up numbers as I didn't look into the exact draw of the servo motors.\n\nThe second change you could make which would benefit the simulated battery is to have a delayed reward, so instead of getting a reward after each action, you get a reward after either making it a certain distance or fully depleting the battery, and this would reset the simulation. This would encourage Bittle to not only move in a certain direction, but to also conserve energy with movements.

It helps a loootttt..."", 'Hi sentdex, I know I am three years late, but I want to add that there actually is a quick way of computing the output size of the convolutional layers, but it depends on multiple factors. Here, it boils down to:\n128 * [50 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2]^2 = 128 * 2 * 2,\nwhere 128 is the number of output channels, 50 is the input size, / denotes floor division and the operations in the brackets are written in order from left to right for readability.\nI will now try to explain, how I came up with this formula:\nThe first thing we need to regard is the input size. Here, we have a 50x50 image. This is our starting point, the size of the resulting feature maps will (usually) never exceed the input size.\nThe next important parameter is the kernel size of the convolutional layers. For this tutorial, you used a 5 by 5 kernel. (To understand how it will affect the input layer, you must regard other parameters like kernel stride etc., but since you used the default values, I won\'t explain them here) The kernel will convolute a 5x5 grid into a new value, then move to the next position, until the whole input image is processed into a so-called ""feature map"". So, how big is this feature map? Because the kernel operates on a 5x5 grid, it will start with its center aligned on pixel index index (2, 2) (index ranging from 0 to 49) and end on pixel index (47, 47). Therefore, there is a 2 pixel margin on each side, which is ""lost"" in the feature map. The resulting feature map is 2 pixels smaller than the input image on each side, resulting in a size of 46*46. I don\'t know if my explanation is good enough, for anyone wondering, try to find some visualizations of convolutional neural networks, it really helps to understand how they operate.\nThe next step is maxpooling. Here, we use a 2x2 kernel. Effectively, this means that the size of our feature maps will be halved, leaving us with a 23*23 feature map. However, this was only the first convolutional layer!\nSo, let\'s repeat this calculation twice:\nSecond Layer: (23, 23) - (4, 4) = (19, 19), (19, 19) / 2= (9, 9)\nThird Layer: (9, 9) - (4, 4) = (5, 5), (5, 5) / 2 = (2, 2)\nFinally, we have to multiply the size of the feature map with the number of output channels of the final convolutional layer, which is 128.', 'Here is how they got to a flattened size of 4x4x50:\nInput image size is 28x28x1 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 20 features) -> 24x24x20 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 12x12x20 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 50 features) -> 8x8x50 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 4x4x50.\n\nHere is how you got to 2x2x128:\nInput image size is 50x50x1 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 32 features) -> 46x46x32 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 23x23x32 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 64 features) -> 19x19x64 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 9x9x64 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 128 features) -> 5x5x128 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 2x2x128.\n\nYou get those numbers when doing calculations on paper first :)\n\n* this is considering you use a padding of 0 (no padding) and a stride of 1.', 'PyTorch (2022) now offers a flatten function from what I recall.', 'How to calculate input size of first fully-connected layer. To do it you have to understand what happening with matrix size during each operation. Layer have have kernel 5x5 and padding = 0. That means that layer will cut 2 pixels from each side reducing matrix size by 4 in each dimension. Also max pool 2x2 will reduce matrix size in half. In our case we have:\nInput image is 50x50\nConv2d(1, 32, (5, 5))  |  50x50x1 -> 46x46x32\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  46x46x32 -> 23x23x32\nConv2d(32, 64, (5, 5))  |  23x23x32 -> 19x19x64\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  19x19x64 -> 9x9x64\nConv2d(64, 128, (5, 5))  |  9x9x64 -> 5x5x128\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  5x5x128 -> 2x2x128\nNow we know size of the matrix (2x2) and we defined the number of channels (128) before, so we can define input size of fc1.\n2x2x128 = 512', 'bro it shows error like ""Found dtype Double but expected Float"" what should I do now?', 'What would the 4th dimension usally be?

I finally found which sentence I missed!', 'Question: How did they get 4*4*50 . \nAnswer: \n28*28 Input Image\nStep1: After 1st Convolution layer with Kernel size 5, output becomes 24x24 \nStep2: Max Pool makes this as 12x12\nStep3: Second convolution Layer with Kernel size 5 makes it 8x8 \nStep4: Max Pool makes it half that is 4x4\n\nand since second convolution layer output is 50, hence there are 50 of these 4x4 features. Hence the number 4*4*50', 'i use kaggle for training deep learning models']"

So its a two step problem: hit the wall once and then search for food. But the first step is happening quickly because of the drift.  This will help learning. The q-values will be significantly higher for states when food and player are same color squares so I imagine it gets there quickly and because of the value differences.\nYou could also think of the state space as being 50 states where player and food are on same colour and 50 states where player and food on different colors.  In other words, there is one state space where there is a food item and another state space where there isn't any food.  The drift term ensures frequent transitions between these two state spaces so I imagine it will learn quite quickly the food state is more valuable than the non-food state and you'll have a positive slope for q-values towards the state with the food item.\n  \nI""]"

It appears that, rather than being arbitrary, you inadvertently thought that Feb-2015 is the latest month and year of unemployment rate data.  If so, you're mistaken.  If you further explore the unemployment data, you'll find that unemployment rates are available all the way through December 2016.  Given the presidential election politics in the US (and in any country for that matter), the unemployment rates and resulting public sentiment become most relevant/influential just before such important elections.  Therefore, a better example would have explored the correlation/covariance between the county-wise unemployment rates and the voting data as of October/November 2016.  Just to be sure, I do understand that your intent was just to show how one could find some correlation between seemingly disparate data.

Then you let AI make the choice X percent of the time and if the choice is hard to make, you keep X very low. But later, you start increasing X as your AI grows smart enough to compensate for some losses in favor of training and eventually it will be the AI making all the choices. This way, a lot of what your AI learns might depend on your own logic that you begin with but if you train for long enough after increasing X for all choices to 100, AI will definitely develop a  unique style. \n\nGood work!

The reason for this for you bot to improve later on by if you see either the enemy collecting crystals only or is it already out on gas. The reason behind it if you ever want to try your bot out against players or against stronger bots(would be rly fun later on) should predict a tactic which should be built upon the enemy is out on gas or not (early gas means sooner ""techning"" means more advenced units and if you see that either you can mass zealot and rush them before they finish or just expand as well to tech too) And in starcraft everything is about time frame so if you see the enemy on gas before xy time with scout you could built in a true/false statment then you dont need to build cybernetic core or other base make gateway and overwhelm them with zealots. That could have been an option to choose. I think the ai should have choose between strategies then you indentify those strategies instead of choosing between units.

This way w will be tested for the number of angles to the x-axis you specify with pi_frac.

"", ""The reason the order doesn't matter is because you're using blocking send and recv, so the receiving rank will block in the receive until it gets the data that it's expecting.\xa0 What you've essentially done by adding the sleep is introduce an artificial load imbalance between the two processes, but since both are using blocking send/recv, neither will progress until its part has completed. (For most MPI implementations, the send may actually start progressing again before the data has actually been sent over the wire. The data doesn't have to arrived, but it must be safe to overwrite the send buffer once the send routine returns) Now, if you replaced your receive with a non-blocking receive, your print could (and likely would) happen before the data has been received. I think the reason you were able to run multiple ranks\xa0 on that node without things getting hung up due to python's global lock is because you're likely running 2 python interpreters in two separate processes (as opposed to threading within a single interpreter).
