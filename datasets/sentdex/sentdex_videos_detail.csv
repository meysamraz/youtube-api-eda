FyhxoHKFIiY,sentdex,Attacking and Defeating the Enemy - Starcraft 2 AI with Python (p.3),"Welcome to part 3 of the Starcraft AI with Python series. In the previous tutorials we learned the basics of writing an AI agent within Starcraft 2, but we've not yet been able to defeat the enemy computer player. In order to do this, we're going to need to go on the offensive. There are many different types of units that we can go with to play more offensively, but my unit of choice is going to be the Void Ray. This is a good general purpose unit that flies around and shoots a laser beam.

HlLK5BA0wT0,sentdex,Starcraft 2 AI with Python - Introduction (p.1),"Welcome to a tutorial for building artificial intelligence agents within Blizzard's Starcraft 2 game. I visited this topic some years ago, but quite a bit has changed, so I figured I would revisit it again. For those of you who are new to Starcraft 2 (SC2) or it's been a while, the game at a basic level is actually fairly easy to understand. In order to be highly competitive, lots of factors can indeed come into play, but if you're looking for a fun environment to try your programming and maybe even deep learning/reinforcement learning skills, this is a pretty good choice.

To begin, there are several types of objects in Carla. First, you of course have the ""world."" This is your environment. Then, you have the actors within this world. Actors are things like your car, the sensors on your car, pedestrians, and so on. Finally, we have blueprints. The blueprints are the attributes of our actors.

With this information, let's start writing some actual code. To begin, let's just make a car that spawns in and simply drives forward and then we want to see the information from a regular RGB camera that we'll place on the hood of the car.

Q-Learning is a model-free form of machine learning, in the sense that the AI ""agent"" does not need to know or have a model of the environment that it will be in. The same algorithm can be used across a variety of environments.

For a given environment, everything is broken down into ""states"" and ""actions."" The states are observations and samplings that we pull from the environment, and the actions are the choices the agent has made based on the observation. For the purposes of the rest of this tutorial, we'll use the context of our environment to exemplify how this works.

My plan here is to find some datasets and do some of the common data analysis tasks, using the Pandas package, to hopefully get you familiar enough with the package to work with it on your own.

It's a deep dream through the inception v3 model's layers that's trained on imagenet, and then the dream is allowed to run wild through various layers of the network, generating things that represent the various layers. Think of it like letting the neural network ""amplify"" what it thinks it sees...we can then amplify this amplification continuously and maybe manipulate the image, by, say, zooming in a bit. For example, the earlier layers are more like straight lines, then squares, then more circles....then things like eyes, maybe some faces and buildings...etc. 

A tutorial on how this was done to come eventually.

In this tutorial, we're going to write a script to automatically play games with this bot versus itself, and then we'll take just the moves of the winning player, saving them as training data for an AI.

In this tutorial and the subsequent ones, I will be breaking down some of our options for using neural networks, or even many other classifiers, for playing Halite II.

To do AI, in general, you need a fixed featureset and fixed labels. The featureset is an input vector to the neural network and the labels will be the output layer. Featuresets must all be identical, and each index in each featureset must be of identical type to the next featureset's index.

So far, we've found a way to drastically improve our rank just by making a slight modification to the starter code given to us. At this point, I notice there are a few issues. One issue is that my ships often ""forget"" their objective and give the impression that they're changing their minds. We need to remember our objectives beyond the single turn. Also, we noticed that the ends of matches had our ships often just sitting there idle, stacking up until the end of the match. We might as well use our ships to attack. Doing this means we can lower enemy numbers, but we can also over-take planets that our enemy owns and make them our own, furthering our chances of winning.

Here, we're going to discuss our model. There are endless models that you could come up with and use, or find online and adapt to your needs. My main interest was in sequence to sequence models, since sequence to sequence models can be used for a chatbot, sure, but can also be used for a whole host of other things too. Basically everything in life can be reduced to sequences being mapped to sequences, so we could train quite a bit of things. For now though: I want a chatbot.

We've been talking about structs, and we saw how to create a struct in the previous tutorial, along with accessing values from the struct. Now, we're curious about how methods might work. While Go doesn't have classes, it does have methods. The methods are not defined within the struct, however. Instead, they're associated with the struct. Here, you can either let these methods just access data via working as a copy of the struct, or you can actually point through and modify the object. Methods that just access values are called value receivers and methods that can modify information are pointer receivers.

Leading up to this point, we've built a training dataset that consists of 80x60 resized game imagery data, along with keyboard inputs for A,W, and D (left, forward, and right respectively).

Next, we need to create and train a neural network for this task.

Before we get into the neural network model, and training it, one other thing to think about is that, chances are, the vast majority of our moves are going to be forward. If we throw data at a neural network that is, for example, 80% biased towards this, the neural network will learn to always predict that class, EXCEPT in cases where it's seen that it is not. The problem here is that the network will almost certainly overfit. So, in training and validation, you might see that you're accuracy is 99%, so surely it's not just only predicting that 80% class, but, then, you throw some out out sample data at the network, or even attempt to actually use it, and you're baffled by the results! Well, you over fit and then created a bunch of rules basically for the edge cases in a case of overfitment.

CLFp9D9-0Eo,sentdex,Self-driving Car - Python plays Grand Theft Auto 5 p.7,"As I was contemplating the next steps, I was curious about a couple of choices for Artificially Intelligent driving. One thought I had was that we could detect both lanes, and then attempt to orient the car in between the two lanes, so long as those two lanes had different slopes. 

...then I began to think about it, and wondered if the problem coudl be even more simple than that. I noticed that the times when the lanes would ""both"" be on one side or the other was when we were getting to close to one of the edges. 

So next I wondered, hmm, what if we just work with the following logic:

If one lane's slope is positive, and the other is negative, then we're fine, continue straight. 

If both lane's slopes are negative, then we're too far left, and we should turn right.

If both lane's slopes are posotive, then we're too far right, and we should turn left.

...surely it can't be that simple right?

I am just going to throw my function in. It's not the best, and I am hoping someone comes up with something better. That said, while we wait for a savior, my code works in the following way:

First, find the main lines. Next, find the groups of lines that are similar to eachother (by comparing slope and bias), and save these as ""the same line."" Next, take the two most common lines, and assume these must be our lanes. After we've done ROI, the next most likely ""line"" just simply is almost certain to be the lanes.

The idea of Python's logging module is to make your life easier. Have you ever maybe added print functions/statements in your code at various places to note where your code is and what's running? Then maybe commented it out? Maybe you got fancy and created a constant like debug = True, then had some lines like if debug: print(something). If this sounds like you, or if it sounds like something that you might find useful, chances are, you should be using logging instead. Maybe you haven't yet needed to do such things, but, eventually you may find yourself in a situation where you do want to temporarily track what your code is doing, but not always. Using print can help in a pinch, but your life will be easier in the long run if you bake logging into your code early on. With logging, you can both output to console as well as saving to a file, all depending on varying debugging levels you can choose from.

Almost immediately, you will be able to see some of the benefits of OOP, but OOP is also a gift that keeps on giving.

Object Oriented Programming is a hard thing to define, but it's centered around the creation of objects and interacting with them, as you might guess. Objects have characteristics and features, known as attributes, and can do various things, through their methods. The biggest feature of OOP is how well objects can be interacted with, and even molded in the future, which makes them very friendly to developers, scale, change over time, testing, and much more.

If these processes are fine to act on their own, without communicating with eachother or back to the main program, then this is fine. These processes can also share a common database, or something like that to work together, but, many times, it will make more sense to use multiprocessing to do some processing, and then return results back to the main program.

Let us take a moment to talk about the GIL. The GIL stands for Global Interpreter Lock. What the GIL does for us is... hmm... well it serves as a sort of memory management safeguard. Sounds like a good idea I guess, but not really. The real problem is that, since the GIL has existed, people have built infrastructure around it. There are better options today, but ripping out the GIL would be catastrophic.

Alright, so the GIL is here to stay for probably a while. What's that mean? Python is single threaded. Even if you use threading, Python runs on a single CPU. If you have 4 physical cores, your computer probably thinks you have 8, and you're using 1 of those 8, including when threading. All threading really lets you do is access idle threads, and nothing more. It's not using more power, its just using idle power. If you monitor your CPU %, you might see that you're only using 10 or 15%, instead of the desired 100%, or at least close to it.

Well that stinks! What can we do?! Enter multiprocessing!

In many cases, you really don't need to actually write a generator over just writing a generator expression. It's also more Pythonic to go ahead and just write the generator expression since it's simpler. That said, you should still know how to write a generator, since it will give you a bit more insight into how generators work, and what iterable objects really are, since, despite looking a lot like list comprehension, generators are very unique in how they act.

Argparse tutorial: https://pythonprogramming.net/argparse-cli-intermediate-python-tutorial/

In the basics series, we actually just used the sys library, which can also work, but isn't quite as extensive.

Having even just a very basic command-line interface (CLI) for your program can make everyone's life easier for modifying parameters, including programmers, but also non-programmers. A CLI for your program can also make it easier to automate running and modifying variables within your program, for when you want to run your program with a cronjob or maybe an os.system call.

Up to this point, my tutorials have all been done using very basic, rudimentary Python. My definition of basic Python: code that is meant to ""just make it run."" This is fine for beginners, because there's not much point in overloading with nuances (most people wont retain it, since they don't care, at least I didn't when I was starting out).

I define intermediate Python code as:

Modular - Easily used by others and/or in other projects by you or others. Basically, write code with the intention to honor DRY (don't repeat yourself).
Maintainable - ...Both by the original author and by other users. Is it easily read-able and understood?
Scales - For this to happen, code needs to be efficient when it runs, and be able to scale. Think about reading files, working with requests, or doing calculations. Maintainability also plays a major role in scaling.
In general, code that meets the above standards in Python is done with the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. There does exist another paradigm, called Functional Programming (FP), and there are bloody wars fought over which is better. We're going to use OOP. Either one of these is better than outright scripting, which what most beginner programmers are really doing.

To begin this series, I am going to teach a few basic standard library functions and functionalities of Python that will replace otherwise bad habits in programming, before getting into Object Oriented Programming and design.

io6Ajf5XkaM,sentdex,Installing the GPU version of TensorFlow for making use of your CUDA GPU,"Welcome to part nine of the Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow tutorials.

If you are going to realistically continue with deep learning, you're going to need to start using a GPU. While there exists demo data that, like the MNIST sample we used, you can successfully work with, it is not going to prepare you for many of the hardships that large datasets come with, and you wont be able to try out many of the more interesting examples of what neural networks are capable of.

Thus, in this tutorial, we're going to be covering the GPU version of TensorFlow. In order to use the GPU version of TensorFlow, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with a compute capability greater than 3.0. I had been using a couple GTX 980s, which had been relatively decent, but I was not able to create models to the size that I wanted so I have bought a GTX Titan X instead, which is much more enjoyable to work with, so pay close attention to VRAM on the card. 4 GB is what I had on my 980s, which gives you 8 GB total, but 4+4 in SLI is not the same as 8GB on one card, for example. You can use two cards at once, but this is not ideal. Buy the single best GPU that you can.

The MNIST dataset has the images, which we'll be working with as purely black and white, thresholded, images, of size 28 x 28, or 784 pixels total. Our features will be the pixel values for each pixel, thresholded. Either the pixel is ""blank"" (nothing there, a 0), or there is something there (1). Those are our features. We're going to attempt to just use this extremely rudimentary data, and predict the number we're looking at (a 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9).

pnSBZ6TEVjY,sentdex,TensorFlow Basics - Deep Learning with Neural Networks p. 2,"Welcome to part two of Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow, and part 44 of the Machine Learning tutorial series. In this tutorial, we are going to be covering some basics on what TensorFlow is, and how to begin using it.

Libraries like TensorFlow and Theano are not simply deep learning libraries, they are libraries *for* deep learning. They are actually just number-crunching libraries, much like Numpy is. The difference is, however, a package like TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. But that's not all! We can even distribute computations across a distributed network of computers with TensorFlow. So, while TensorFlow is mainly being used with machine learning right now, it actually stands to have uses in other fields, since really it is just a massive array manipulation library.

What is a tensor? Up to this point in the machine learning series, we've been working mainly with vectors (numpy arrays), and a tensor can be a vector. Most simply, a tensor is an array-like object, and, as you've seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.

You are free to use whatever setup you want, but I am personally going to be using Ubuntu 16.04, on a Virtual Machine, on my Windows machine. At the moment, it is still relatively unclear about what platform people will be executing their machine learning models on, so who knows what sort of operating system will become king in the end for this field.

oYbVFhK_olY,sentdex,Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow Introduction,"Welcome to a new section in our Machine Learning Tutorial series: Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow. The artificial neural network is a biologically-inspired methodology to conduct machine learning, intended to mimic your brain (a biological neural network).

The Artificial Neural Network, which I will now just refer to as a neural network, is not a new concept. The idea has been around since the 1940's, and has had a few ups and downs, most notably when compared against the Support Vector Machine (SVM). For example, the Neural Network was popularized up until the mid 90s when it was shown that the SVM, using a new-to-the-public (the technique itself was thought up long before it was actually put to use) technique, the ""Kernel Trick,"" was capable of working with non-linearly separable datasets. With this, the Support Vector Machine catapulted to the front again, leaving neural nets behind and mostly nothing interesting until about 2011, where Deep Neural Networks began to take hold and outperform the Support Vector Machine, using new techniques, huge dataset availability, and much more powerful computers.

TO8I-nggpzs,sentdex,Mean Shift with Titanic Dataset - Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python p.40,"We continue the topic of clustering and unsupervised machine learning with Mean Shift, this time applying it to our Titanic dataset.

There is some degree of randomness here, so your results may not be the same. You can probably re-run the program to get similar data if you don't get something similar, however.

We're going to take a look at the Titanic dataset via clustering with Mean Shift. What we're interested to know is whether or not Mean Shift will automatically separate passengers into groups or not. If so, it will be interesting to inspect the groups that are created. The first obvious curiosity will be the survival rates of the groups found, but, then, we will also poke into the attributes of these groups to see if we can understand why the Mean Shift algorithm decided on the specific groups.

3ERPpzrDkVg,sentdex,Mean Shift Intro - Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python p.39,"Mean Shift is very similar to the K-Means algorithm, except for one very important factor: you do not need to specify the number of groups prior to training. The Mean Shift algorithm finds clusters on its own. For this reason, it is even more of an ""unsupervised"" machine learning algorithm than K-Means.

The way Mean Shift works is to go through each featureset (a datapoint on a graph), and proceed to do a hill climb operation. Hill Climbing is just as it sounds: The idea is to continually increase, or go up, until you cannot anymore. We don't have for sure just one local maximal value. We might have only one, or we might have ten. Our ""hill"" in this case will be the number of featuresets/datapoints within a given radius. The radius is also called a bandwidth, and the entire window is your Kernel. The more data within the window, the better. Once we can no longer take another step without decreasing the number of featuresets/datapoints within the radius, we take the mean of all data in that region and we have located a cluster center. We do this starting from each data point. Many data points will lead to the same cluster center, which should be expected, but it is also possible that other data points will take you to a completely separate cluster center.

In this tutorial, we're going to begin setting up or own SVM from scratch.

Before we dive in, however, I will draw your attention to a few other options for solving this constraint optimization problem:

First, the topic of constraint optimization is massive, and there is quite a bit of material on the subject. Even just our subsection: Convex Optimization, is massive. A starting place might be: https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf. For a starting place for constraint optimization in general, you could also check out http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Constrained-Opt.pdf

Within the realm of Python specifically, the CVXOPT package has various convex optimization methods available, one of which is the quadratic programming problem we have (found @ cvxopt.solvers.qp).

Also, even more specifically there is libsvm's Python interface, or the libsvm package in general. We are opting to not make use of any of these, as the optimization problem for the Support Vector Machine IS basically the entire SVM problem.

Now, to begin our SVM in Python.

K Nearest Neighbors boils down to proximity, not by group, but by individual points. Thus, all this algorithm is actually doing is computing distance between points, and then picking the most popular class of the top K classes of points nearest to it. There are various ways to compute distance on a plane, many of which you can use here, but the most accepted version is Euclidean Distance, named after Euclid, a famous mathematician who is popularly referred to as the father of Geometry, and he definitely wrote the book (The Elements) on it.

What happens, however, when your linear regression model is applied within 20 hierarchical layers in a neural network? Not only this, but your model works in steps, or windows, of say 100 data points at a time, within a dataset of 5 million datapoints. You're going to need some sort of automated way of discovering how good your best fit line actually is.

Where we left off, we had just realized that we needed to replicate some non-trivial algorithms into Python code in an attempt to calculate a best-fit line for a given dataset.

Before we embark on that, why are we going to bother with all of this? Linear Regression is basically the brick to the machine learning building. It is used in almost every single major machine learning algorithm, so an understanding of it will help you to get the foundation for most major machine learning algorithms. For the enthusiastic among us, understanding linear regression and general linear algebra is the first step towards writing your own custom machine learning algorithms and branching out into the bleeding edge of machine learning, using what ever the best processing is at the time. As processing improves and hardware architecture changes, the methodologies used for machine learning also change. The more recent rise in neural networks has had much to do with general purpose graphics processing units. Ever wonder what's at the heart of an artificial neural network? You guessed it: linear regression.

Up to this point, you have been shown the value of linear regression and how to apply it with Scikit Learn and Python, now we're going to dive into how it is calculated. While I do not believe it is necessary to dig into all of the math that goes into every machine learning algorithm (have you dug into the source code of your other favorite modules to see how they do every little thing?), linear algebra is essential to machine learning, and it is useful to understand the true building blocks that machine learning is built upon.

The objective of linear algebra is to calculate relationships of points in vector space. This is used for a variety of things, but one day, someone got the wild idea to do this with features of a dataset. We can too! Remember before when we defined the type of data that linear regression was going to work on was called ""continuous"" data? This is not so much due to what people just so happen to use linear regression for, it is due to the math that makes it up. Simple linear regression is used to find the best fit line of a dataset. If the data isn't continuous, there really isn't going to be a best fit line

In this tutorial, we'll talk about some next steps.

I remember the first time that I was trying to learn about machine learning, and most examples were only covering up to the training and testing part, totally skipping the prediction part. Of the tutorials that did the training, testing, and predicting part, I did not find a single one that explained saving the algorithm. With examples, data is generally pretty small overall, so the training, testing, and prediction process is relatively fast. In the real world, however, data is likely to be larger, and take much longer for processing. Since no one really talked about this important stage, I wanted to definitely include some information on processing time and saving your algorithm.

While our machine learning classifier takes a few seconds to train, there may be cases where it takes hours or even days to train a classifier. Imagine needing to do that every day you wanted to forecast prices, or whatever. This is not necessary, as we can just save the classifier using the Pickle module.

QLVMqwpOLPk,sentdex,Regression forecasting and predicting - Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python p.5,"In this video, make sure you define the X's like so. I flipped the last two lines by mistake: 

X = np.array(df.drop(['label'],1))
X = preprocessing.scale(X)
X_lately = X[-forecast_out:]
X = X[:-forecast_out:]

To forecast out, we need some data. We decided that we're forecasting out 10% of the data, thus we will want to, or at least *can* generate forecasts for each of the final 10% of the dataset. So when can we do this? When would we identify that data? We could call it now, but consider the data we're trying to forecast is not scaled like the training data was. Okay, so then what? Do we just do preprocessing.scale() against the last 10%? The scale method scales based on all of the known data that is fed into it. Ideally, you would scale both the training, testing, AND forecast/predicting data all together. Is this always possible or reasonable? No. If you can do it, you should, however. In our case, right now, we can do it. Our data is small enough and the processing time is low enough, so we'll preprocess and scale the data all at once.

In many cases, you wont be able to do this. Imagine if you were using gigabytes of data to train a classifier. It may take days to train your classifier, you wouldn't want to be doing this every...single...time you wanted to make a prediction. Thus, you may need to either NOT scale anything, or you may scale the data separately. As usual, you will want to test both options and see which is best in your specific case.

With that in mind, let's handle all of the rows from the definition of X onward.

In the previous tutorials, we got our initial data, we transformed and manipulated it a bit to our liking, and then we began to define our features. Scikit-Learn does not fundamentally need to work with Pandas and dataframes, I just prefer to do my data-handling with it, as it is fast and efficient. Instead, Scikit-learn actually fundamentally requires numpy arrays. Pandas dataframes can be easily converted to NumPy arrays, so it just so happens to work out for us!

It is a typical standard with machine learning in code to define X (capital x), as the features, and y (lowercase y) as the label that corresponds to the features. As such, we can define our features and labels like so.

lN5jesocJjk,sentdex,Regression Features and Labels - Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python p.3,"We'll be using the numpy module to convert data to numpy arrays, which is what Scikit-learn wants. We will talk more on preprocessing and cross_validation when we get to them in the code, but preprocessing is the module used to do some cleaning/scaling of data prior to machine learning, and cross_ alidation is used in the testing stages. Finally, we're also importing the LinearRegression algorithm as well as svm from Scikit-learn, which we'll be using as our machine learning algorithms to demonstrate results.

At this point, we've got data that we think is useful. How does the actual machine learning thing work? With supervised learning, you have features and labels. The features are the descriptive attributes, and the label is what you're attempting to predict or forecast. Another common example with regression might be to try to predict the dollar value of an insurance policy premium for someone. The company may collect your age, past driving infractions, public criminal record, and your credit score for example. The company will use past customers, taking this data, and feeding in the amount of the ""ideal premium"" that they think should have been given to that customer, or they will use the one they actually used if they thought it was a profitable amount.

Thus, for training the machine learning classifier, the features are customer attributes, the label is the premium associated with those attributes.

JcI5Vnw0b2c,sentdex,Regression Intro - Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python p.2,"To begin, what is regression in terms of us using it with machine learning? The goal is to take continuous data, find the equation that best fits the data, and be able forecast out a specific value. With simple linear regression, you are just simply doing this by creating a best fit line.

From here, we can use the equation of that line to forecast out into the future, where the 'date' is the x-axis, what the price will be.

A popular use with regression is to predict stock prices. This is done because we are considering the fluidity of price over time, and attempting to forecast the next fluid price in the future using a continuous dataset.

Regression is a form of supervised machine learning, which is where the scientist teaches the machine by showing it features and then showing it was the correct answer is, over and over, to teach the machine. Once the machine is taught, the scientist will usually ""test"" the machine on some unseen data, where the scientist still knows what the correct answer is, but the machine doesn't. The machine's answers are compared to the known answers, and the machine's accuracy can be measured. If the accuracy is high enough, the scientist may consider actually employing the algorithm in the real world.

OGxgnH8y2NM,sentdex,Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python Intro p.1,"The objective of this course is to give you a holistic understanding of machine learning, covering theory, application, and inner workings of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms.

In this series, we'll be covering linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks.

For each major algorithm that we cover, we will discuss the high level intuitions of the algorithms and how they are logically meant to work. Next, we'll apply the algorithms in code using real world data sets along with a module, such as with Scikit-Learn. Finally, we'll be diving into the inner workings of each of the algorithms by recreating them in code, from scratch, ourselves, including all of the math involved. This should give you a complete understanding of exactly how the algorithms work, how they can be tweaked, what advantages are, and what their disadvantages are.

In order to follow along with the series, I suggest you have at the very least a basic understanding of Python. If you do not, I suggest you at least follow the Python 3 Basics tutorial until the module installation with pip tutorial. If you have a basic understanding of Python, and the willingness to learn/ask questions, you will be able to follow along here with no issues. Most of the machine learning algorithms are actually quite simple, since they need to be in order to scale to large datasets. Math involved is typically linear algebra, but I will do my best to still explain all of the math. If you are confused/lost/curious about anything, ask in the comments section on YouTube, the community here, or by emailing me. You will also need Scikit-Learn and Pandas installed, along with others that we'll grab along the way.

Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the ""field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."" This means imbuing knowledge to machines without hard-coding it.

https://pythonprogramming.net/quadcopter-flight-and-legal-tutorial/

There are two major types of propellelers. Some are threaded, some arent. If your motor's shaft isn't threaded, then you cannot use the threaded propellers.

Threaded propellers are usually both the propeller and attachment system all in one. This is nice for quickly attaching and detatching the propellers, but it does not allow for you to balance the propeller. Almost no propellers come perfectly balanced, so you can safely assume the quick detatch ones are not perfect either. Despite this, I have had no issues personally with adjusting for differences in balance by modifying trim on the controller. If you can, then you can balance a propeller by adding tiny bits of tape to the underside of the propeller to add weight, and you use a propeller balancer.

First, in order for your quadcopter to fly properly, you have to calibrate the ESCs. There are multiple ways to do this. At the most basic level, you can calibrate ESCs one by one, but, when using a control board, you can calibrate them all at the same time. Depending on your board, getting the ESC calibration mode might be different. If you are using the board we're using, you do this by holding button 1 and 4 down when you power on the quadcopter.

For exactly how you put together your frame, see the instructions with it. For exact placement for your other parts, that's all up to you for the most part. Your flight control board needs to be at the center point for balance purposes.

Some motors are universal, others are specifically threaded. If your motor is ""self tightening,"" then this means it is meant to spin in only one direction in order to keep the propellers on. Pictured below contains the intended motor rotation, along with motor numbers. Generally, if you have threaded motor shafts, then motors 1 and 3 will have black tips and 2 and 4 will be silver.

Hello and welcome to the second tutorial covering how to build a quadcopter. We're going to be covering the supplies that you will need.

All quadcopters break down to the following (I will link to specific parts further down, do not want to clutter things at this point):

Frame - This is what everything attaches to.

Motors - Things that spin

ESC - Electronic Speed Controllers, which dictate the speed at which your motors spin.

Propellers - Attaches to motor to be spun and generate down-force

Receiver (and transmitter) - Usually these come together. The transmitter is your ""remote controller"" and the receiver is what sits on the quadcopter to accept the incoming signal.

Flight Control Board - Receives signal from your receiver, which then feeds out to your ESCs. Most flight control boards also have some basic stability control that helps to keep your quadcopter balanced.

LiPo (Lithium Polymer) Battery - powers your quadcopter! Somewhere in the range of 1.3 - 2.2 amps.

Power distribution Board - Takes power in from your battery, powers the ESCs which then power your motors, and also powers the flight control board.

In this Quantopian tutorial, we're going to be covering the Pipeline API. If you recall leading up to this, we were often limited by what we wanted to do, usually be a 255 maximum on our stock universe. The Pipeline API allows you to select from more like 8000+ securities at a time, which opens the door to many new opportunities.

The Pipeline API can reference 8000+ securities at a time, but you can still only reference 500 in realtime. Thus, you will most likely use the Pipeline API in conjunction with update_universe.

In order to take 8000 securities and get to a number small enough to work with your universe, you will be using Factors and Filters, many times together. A factor is used to return numbers, and a filter returns a boolean. For example, you may use a factor first to apply a 50 and a 200 moving average to the companies. Then you may employ a filter to return all companies that have a 50 moving average above the 200 moving average.

Just when you thought you've seen most of the backend magic that Django has to offer, there's more! The Django admin site/app is pretty incredible. This is your Admin Control Panel, and it's already done. Just like Django handles your database work with the models.py, your Admin page is going to work very much in the same way. To access the admin page, you visit /admin/, assuming the admin app is indeed installed.

Our plan is to add the final element of our website: a blog. So far, we've worked with views and a controller, but have not really done anything with models.

First off, what are models? Models contain ""meta data"" regarding your application's data. Generally, these models are used to describe just the elements in your database, but they can be built up to be much more than just that.

Second, we know we want to make a blog. Is this blog a part of our ""personal"" website, or would it make more sense to be its own app? It could be a part of our personal app, but it really ought to be its own entirely. Plus, chances are, we're going to want to incorporate a blog on other apps, so let's make a new app: python manage.py startapp blog.

We just added a new app. What is the first thing we should do? Right, install it!

FNQxxpM1yOs,sentdex,Introduction - Django Web Development with Python 1,"Welcome to a Django web development with Python tutorial series. Django is a Python web development framework, aimed at rapid development and deployment.

One of the more common questions people have is ""which framework"" they should use. There are quite a few for Python, with Django and Flask being the two most popular.

Flask is more of what we call a ""micro"" web framework. It is much ""lower level"" than Django is. This allows for more customization and control for the developer.

Django is much more of a higher-level framework, and imposes a set structure on the developer.

Thus, with Flask you can create systems your way, which is probably not most efficient, fastest, or secure way. With Django, you are a bit more constrained, but you are going to most likely do it the best way possible. As with almost all questions people ask me regarding which to use, the answer is: Try a few, and choose the one you like best. In the end, Django and Flask can be used to make the exact same websites!

To try Django, you need to get Django first (you will also need Python installed). This is exceptionally simple:

pip install Django

o-vsdfCBpsU,sentdex,"Creating a database, table, and inserting - SQLite3 with Python 3 part 1","Welcome to an SQLite mini-series! SQLite, as the name suggests, is a lite version of an SQL database. SQLite3 comes as a part of the Python 3 standard library.

Databases offer, typically, a superior method of high-volume data input and output over a typical file such as a text file. SQLite is a ""light"" version that works based on SQL syntax. SQL is a programming language in itself, but is a very popular database language. Many websites use MySQL, for example.

SQLite truly shines because it is extremely lightweight. Setting up an SQLite database is nearly instant, there is no server to set up, no users to define, and no permissions to concern yourself with. For this reason, it is often used as a developmental and protyping database, but it can and is used in production. The main issue with SQLite is that it winds up being much like any other flat-file, so high volume input/output, especially with simultaneous queries, can be problematic and slow. You may then ask, what really is the difference between a typical file and sqlite. First, SQLite will let you structure your data as a database, which can easily be queried, so you get that functionality both with adding new content and calling upon it later. Each table would likely need its own file if you were doing plain files, and SQLite is all in one. SQLite is also going to be buffering your data. A flat file will require a full load before you can start querying the full dataset, SQLite files don't work that way. Finally, edits do not require the entire file to be re-saved, it's just that part of the file. This improves performance significantly. Alright great, let's dive into some SQLite.

Hey, it's an image without a watch, so whatever right? Sure, you could take that opinion, but if you use this pulling method for positive then this is definitely a problem. You could manually delete them... or we can just use our new Image Analysis knowledge to detect these silly images and remove them!

You can also get a VPS from Digital Ocean for as low as $5/month. I would recommend at least 2GB of RAM for what we will be doing. Most hosts nowadays charge by the hour, including Digital Ocean.

2CZltXv-Gpk,sentdex,Template Matching - OpenCV with Python for Image and Video Analysis 11,"Welcome to another OpenCV with Python tutorial, in this tutorial we're going to cover a fairly basic version of object recognition. The idea here is to find identical regions of an image that match a template we provide, giving a certain threshold. For exact object matches, with exact lighting/scale/angle, this can work great. An example where these conditions are usually met is just about any GUI on the computer. The buttons and such are always the same, so you can use template matching. Pair template matching with some mouse controls and you've got yourself a web-based bot!

To start, you will need a main image, and a template. You should take your template from the exact ""thing"" you are looking for in the image. I will provide an image as an example, but feel free to use an image of your favorite website or something like that.

These tend to come in pairs. The first pair we're going to talk about is Erosion and Dilation. Erosion is where we will ""erode"" the edges. The way these work is we work with a slider (kernel). We give the slider a size, let's say 5 x 5 pixels. What happens is we slide this slider around, and if all of the pixels are white, then we get white, otherwise black. This may help eliminate some white noise. The other version of this is Dilation, which basically does the opposite: Slides around, if the entire area isn't black, then it is converted to white.

Alternatively, you could also specifically filter out a specific color, and then replace it with a scene, like we did with replacing a ROI (region of image) with something else, much like how a green screen works.

In order to filter like this you have a few options. Generally, you are probably going to convert your colors to HSV, which is ""Hue Saturation Value."" This can help you actually pinpoint a more specific color, based on hue and saturation ranges, with a variance of value, for example. If you wanted, you could actually produce filters based on BGR values, but this would be a bit more difficult. If you're having a hard time visualizing HSV, don't feel silly, check out the Wikipedia page on HSV, there is a very useful graphic there for you to visualize it. Hue for color, saturation for the strength of the color, and value for light is how I would best describe it personally. Now let's hop in.

In this tutorial, we'll be covering thresholding for image and video analysis. The idea of thresholding is to further-simplify visual data for analysis. First, you may convert to gray-scale, but then you have to consider that grayscale still has at least 255 values. What thresholding can do, at the most basic level, is convert everything to white or black, based on a threshold value. Let's say we want the threshold to be 125 (out of 255), then everything that was 125 and under would be converted to 0, or black, and everything above 125 would be converted to 255, or white. If you convert to grayscale as you normally will, you will get white and black. If you do not convert to grayscale, you will get thresholded pictures, but there will be color.

While that sounds good enough, it often isn't. We will be covering multiple examples and different types of thresholding here to illustrate this.

Allowing for asynchronous loading like this gives you quite a few gains. Immersion, interactivity, and ease of use all go up. Furthermore, speed is improved. Instead of everything needing to reload, just a specific element reloads/loads. Let's consider a simple example, where we ask the user what the best programming language is. If they answer ""python,"" then they are obviously correct and we'll display on the screen they are wise. If they answer anything else, we'll prompt them to try again.

We've come quite a long ways here, and the next, and final, macro step that we want to take here involves looking into economic indicators to see their impact on housing prices, or the HPI.

Text based version of this tutorial and sample code: http://pythonprogramming.net/economic-factors-data-analysis-python-pandas-tutorial/

There are two major economic indicators that come to mind out the gate: S&P 500 index (stock market) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product). I suspect the S&P 500 to be more correlated than the GDP, but the GDP is usually a better overall economic indicator, so I may be wrong. Another macro indicator that I suspect might have value here is the unemployment rate. If you're unemployed, you're probably not getting that mortgage. We'll see though. We've been through the process for adding more data points, so I do not see much point in dragging you all through this process. There will be one new thing to note, however. In the HPI_Benchmark() function, we're changing the ""United States"" column to be US_HPI. This makes a bit more sense when we're bringing in other values now.

For GDP, I couldn't find one that encompassed the full time frame. I am sure you can find a dataset, somewhere, with this data, maybe even on Quandl. Sometimes you have to do some digging. I also had trouble finding a nice long-term monthly unemployment rate. I did find an unemployment level, but we really want more of a percentage/rate, otherwise we need to divide the unemployment level by the population. We could do that if we decide unemployment rate is worth having, but we'll work with what we get first.

FvamL5oA_EE,sentdex,Joining 30 year mortgage rate - p.13 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to Part 13 of our Data Analysis with Python and Pandas, using Real Estate investing as an example. At this point, we've learned quite a bit about what Pandas has to offer us, and we'll come up here with a bit of a challenge! As we've covered so far, we can make relatively low-risk investments based on divergence between highly correlated state pairs and probably do just fine. We'll cover testing this strategy later on, but, for now, let's look into acquiring the other necessary data that comprises housing values: Interest rates. Now, there are many different types of mortgage rates both in the way interest is accrued as well as the time-frame for the loan. Opinions vary over the years, and depending on the current market situation, on whether you want a 10 year, 15 year, or 30 year mortgage. Then you have to consider if you want an adjustable rate, or maybe along the way you decide you want to re-finance your home.

At the end of the data, all of this data is finite, but ultimately will likely be a bit too noisy. For now, let's just keep it simple, and look into the 30 year conventional mortgage rate. Now, this data should be very negatively correlated with the House Price Index (HPI). Before even bothering with this code, I would automatically assume and expect that the correlation wont be as negatively strong as the higher-than-90% that we were getting with state HPI correlation, certainly less than -0.9, but also it should be greater than -0.5. The interest rate is of course important, but correlation to the overall HPI was so very strong because these were very similar statistics. The interest rate is of course related, but not as directly as other HPI values, or the US HPI.

In this tutorial, we're goign to talk briefly on the handling of erroneous/outlier data. Just because data is an outlier, it does not mean it is erroneous. A lot of times, an outlier data point can nullify a hypothesis, so the urge to just get rid of it can be high, but this isn't what we're talking about here.

What would an erroneous outlier be? An example I like to use is when measuring fluctuations in something like, say, a bridge. As bridges carry weight, they can move a bit. In storms, that can wiggle about a bit, there is some natural movement. As time goes on, and supports weaken, the bridge might move a bit too much, and eventually need to be reinforced. Maybe we have a system in place that constantly measures fluctuations in the bridge's height.

FRzfD1FtrsQ,sentdex,Rolling statistics - p.11 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to another data analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial series, where we become real estate moguls. In this tutorial, we're going to be covering the application of various rolling statistics to our data in our dataframes.

One of the more popular rolling statistics is the moving average. This takes a moving window of time, and calculates the average or the mean of that time period as the current value. In our case, we have monthly data. So a 10 moving average would be the current value, plus the previous 9 months of data, averaged, and there we would have a 10 moving average of our monthly data. Doing this is Pandas is incredibly fast. Pandas comes with a few pre-made rolling statistical functions, but also has one called a rolling_apply. This allows us to write our own function that accepts window data and apply any bit of logic we want that is reasonable. This means that even if Pandas doesn't officially have a function to handle what you want, they have you covered and allow you to write exactly what you need. Let's start with a basic moving average, or a rolling_mean as Pandas calls it. You can check out all of the Moving/Rolling statistics from Pandas' documentation.

O5v4NrSCw_A,sentdex,Handling Missing Data - p.10 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to Part 10 of our Data Analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial. In this part, we're going to be talking about missing or not available data. We have a few options when considering the existence of missing data.

Ignore it - Just leave it there
Delete it - Remove all cases. Remove from data entirely. This means forfeiting the entire row of data.
Fill forward or backwards - This means taking the prior or following value and just filling it in.
Replace it with something static - For example, replacing all NaN data with -9999.
Each of these options has their own merits for a variety of reasons. Ignoring it requires no more work on our end. You may choose to ignore missing data for legal reasons, or maybe to retain the utmost integrity of the data. Missing data might also be very important data. For example, maybe part of your analysis is investigating signal drops from a server. In this case, maybe the missing data is super important to keep in the set.

Next, we have delete it. You have another two choices at this point. You can either delete rows if they contain any amount of NaN data, or you can delete the row if it is completely NaN data. Usually a row that is full of NaN data comes from a calculation you performed on the dataset, and no data is really missing, it's just simply not available given your formula. In most cases, you would at least want to drop all rows that are completely NaN, and in many cases you would like to just drop rows that have any NaN data.

p_Fn_BksF9k,sentdex,Resampling - p.9 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to another data analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial. In this tutorial, we're going to be talking about smoothing out data by removing noise. There are two main methods to do this. The most popular method used is what is called resampling, though it might take many other names. This is where we have some data that is sampled at a certain rate. For us, we have the Housing Price Index sampled at a one-month rate, but we could sample the HPI every week, every day, every minute, or more, but we could also resample at every year, every 10 years, and so on.

Another environment where resampling almost always occurs is with stock prices, for example. Stock prices are intra-second. What winds up happening though, is usually stock prices are resampled to minute data at the lowest for free data. You can buy access to live data, however. On a long-term scale, usually the data will be sampled daily, or even every 3-5 days. This is often done to keep the size of the data being transferred low. For example, over the course of, say, one year, intra-second data is usually in the multiples of gigabytes, and transferring all of that at once is unreasonable and people would be waiting minutes or hours for pages to load.

Using our current data, which is currently sampled at once a month, how might we sample it instead to once every 6 months, or 2 years? Try to think about how you might personally write a function that might perform that task, it's a fairly challenging one, but it can be done. That said, it's a fairly computationally inefficient job, but Pandas has our backs and does it very fast.

ylIRlTFt_Fk,sentdex,Concatenating and Appending dataframes  - p.5 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to Part 5 of our Data Analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial series. In this tutorial, we're going to be covering how to combine dataframes in a variety of ways.

In our case with real estate investing, we're hoping to take the 50 dataframes with housing data and then just combine them all into one dataframe. We do this for multiple reasons. First, it is easier and just makes sense to combine these, but also it will result in less memory being used. Every dataframe has a date and value column. This date column is repeated across all the dataframes, but really they should all just share the one, effectively nearly halving our total column count.

When combining dataframes, you might have quite a few goals in mind. For example, you may want to ""append"" to them, where you may be adding to the end, basically adding more rows. Or maybe you want to add more columns, like in our case. There are four major ways of combining dataframes, which we'll begin covering now. The four major ways are: Concatenation, joining, merging, and appending. We'll begin with Concatenation.

3GpvWlVinf0,sentdex,Building dataset - p.4 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"In this part of Data Analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial series, we're going to expand things a bit. Let's consider that we're multi-billionaires, or multi-millionaires, but it's more fun to be billionaires, and we're trying to diversify our portfolio as much as possible. We want to have all types of asset classes, so we've got stocks, bonds, maybe a money market account, and now we're looking to get into real estate to be solid. You've all seen the commercials right? You buy a CD for $60, attend some $500 seminar, and you're set to start making your 6 figure at a time investments into property, right?

Okay, maybe not, but we definitely want to do some research and have some sort of strategy for buying real estate. So, what governs the prices of homes, and do we need to do the research to find this out? Generally, no, you don't really need to do that digging, we know the factors. The factors for home prices are governed by: The economy, interest rates, and demographics. These are the three major influences in general for real estate value. Now, of course, if you're buying land, various other things matter, how level is it, are we going to need to do some work to the land before we can actually lay foundation, how is drainage etc. If there is a house, then we have even more factors, like the roof, windows, heating/AC, floors, foundation, and so on. We can begin to consider these factors later, but first we'll start at the macro level. You will see how quickly our data sets inflate here as it is, it'll blow up fast.

So, our first step is to just collect the data. Quandl still represents a great place to start, but this time let's automate the data grabbing. We're going to pull housing data for the 50 states first, but then we stand to try to gather other data as well. We definitely dont want to be manually pulling this data. First, if you do not already have an account, you need to get one. This will give you an API key and unlimited API requests to the free data, which is awesome.

Once you create an account, go to your account / me, whatever they are calling it at the time, and then find the section marked API key. That's your key, which you will need. Next, we want to grab the Quandl module. We really don't need the module to make requests at all, but it's a very small module, and the size is worth the slight ease it gives us, so might as well. Open up your terminal/cmd.exe and do pip install quandl (again, remember to specify the full path to pip if pip is not recognized).

Next, we're ready to rumble, open up a new editor.

9Z7wvippeko,sentdex,IO Basics - p.3 Data Analysis with Python and Pandas Tutorial,"Welcome to Part 3 of Data Analysis with Pandas and Python. In this tutorial, we will begin discussing IO, or input/output, with Pandas, and begin with a realistic use-case. To get ample practice, a very useful website is Quandl. Quandl contains a plethora of free and paid data sources. What makes this location great is that the data is generally normalized, it's all in one place, and extracting the data is the same method. If you are using Python, and you access the Quandl data via their simple module, then the data is automatically returned to a dataframe. For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to just manually download a CSV file instead, for learning purposes, since not every data source you find is going to have a nice and neat module for extracting the datasets.

Let's say we're interested in maybe purchasing or selling a home in Austin, Texas. The zipcode there is 77006. We could go to the local housing listings and see what the current prices are, but this doesn't really give us any real historical information, so let's just try to get some data on this. Let's query for ""home value index 77006."" Sure enough, we can see an index here. There's top, middle, lower tier, three bedroom, and so on. Let's say, sure, we got a a three bedroom house. Let's check that out. Turns out Quandl already provides graphs, but let's grab the dataset anyway, make our own graph, and maybe do some other analysis. Go to download, and choose CSV. Pandas is capable of IO with csv, excel data, hdf, sql, json, msgpack, html, gbq, stata, clipboard, and pickle data, and the list continues to grow. Check out the IO Tools documentation for the current list. Take that CSV and move it into the local directory (the directory that you are currently working in / where this .py script is).

With bars, you have the starting point of the bar, the height of the bar, and the width of the bar. With a 3D bar, you also get another choice, which is depth of the bar. Most of the time, a bar chart starts with the bar flat on an axis, but you can add another dimension by releasing this constraint as well.

If you are having trouble installing Basemap, check out the pip installation tutorial.

Once you have Basemap installed, you're ready to create maps. First, let's just project a simple map. To do this, we need to import Basemap, pyplot, create the projection, draw at least some sort of outline or data, then we can show the graph.

One option is to put the legend outside of the axis, but we have multiple subplots here and that would be pretty difficult. Instead, we'll make the legend a bit smaller, and then apply an alpha to it.

First, to have a legend, we need to add labels to our data that we want to show up on the legend.

As you can see up to this point, all of these changes we're making to our graphs start to add up, and we only have one axis so far! We could use for loops to at least keep the amount of code down, but we can also make use of these styles with Matplotlib.

The idea of a style page is to write your customization to a style file, and then, to use those changes and apply them to your graph, all you do is import style and then use that specific style. This way, let's say you are finding yourself always changing various elements of your graphs. Instead of having to write 25-200 lines of customization code per chart, you can just write it once to a style, and then load in that style and apply all of those changes in two lines!

YQY0gCgkGzo,sentdex,[See Description] Paper Trading a Strategy on Quantopian - Python for Finance 12,"UPDATED series: https://pythonprogramming.net/quantopian-trading-strategies-introduction-python-programming-for-finance/

This series has become outdated with Quantopian 2.0. 

In this tutorial, we return to an older, more basic, strategy from part 8 of this series in order to talk about live-trading strategies. In our case, we're paper-trading a strategy. 

Before we can paper trade a strategy, we must first run a back test against minute-data. 

As we do this, we have to learn a few things about Quantopian's systems, and implications about strategies, minute data, and paper trading. 

Paper trading is where we take a strategy, and ""forward test"" it against actual market events. We ""trade"" with fake money, but the market events are unique and real. Paper trading still doesn't succumb to trade delays and slippage, but will still help you root out things like overfitting to historical data.

In this tutorial, we add a stop-loss to our trading strategy. The idea of a stop-loss is to exit a position that is turning out to go in a direction that is opposite to what is expected. 

When you enter a stop loss, you have purchased an instrument, and then you set a price where, if the market price falls to hit or go below it, you will sell that instrument off. This is a way to automatically get out of a losing strategy.

There, all of the possible fundamentals are  listed. Definitely worth checking out to see all of the many options.

So, get_fundamentals works to pull one of 600 fundamental metrics for companies. To get started, you need to build a query, and the queries are built with SQL alchemy syntax. Luckily, if you start to just type get_fundamentals, and then choose the auto complete, it will just create the baseline for the query for you.

In this tutorial, we break down the major elements to creating and testing an automated trading strategy, using Quantopian, which is mainly the pairing of Python with Zipline.

The basic required elements to all trading strategies through Python's zipline module are initialize and handle_data methods. 

The initialize method is used for setting any global parameters (stored in the context variable), and is run once at the very beginning of the algorithm. The handle_data method is run once per time series window, which is either one day, or one minute with Quantopian.

What is going on welcome to a python for finance tutorial video.

Just to clarify right out of the gate, a lot of people envision programming as being used solely for high frequency trading, since computers can execute trades faster than people.

While that is true, and computers are used for High Frequency Trading (HFT), they are also used for a whole lot more in finance. We're going to show the use of programming for things like simple algorithmic trades like moving average crossovers, all the way to utilizing things like machine learning. 

Computers can be used for really anything from high frequency trading to long term investing. 

Computers allow you to test all of your ideas through what is called back-testing.

Back testing is where we take our trading strategies and apply them to historical data to see how they would have done if we had employed them.

Back testing comes with some inherent flaws. First off, the usual warning about historical results are not indicative of future ones, and back testing also tends to ignore things like execution time, or how long it takes to actually make a trade. Depending on execution time and the order size, you're almost certainly to experience what is called skid / slippage. Skid/slip is the change in price during an order, from the point of execution initialization to when you actually complete the order.

All that said, back testing is still a must, and you will find as we go through this series that back testing can become a reliable method for looking into the future, and we can also add risk metrics on top of it.

So, this series is going to go through automated trading with python for finance.

It would be helpful to have at least some background in Python, though I will do my best to make it not necessary. I will explain the code each step of the way, and, should you have any questions or confusions, I am always happy to help.

So let's get started. To do this series, we're going to build everything on top
of a service called Quantopian. Quantopian is a web app that allows us to write pure
python code, it's not a rendition of python, it is python, in their web based IDE, which is the editor we write code into.

They have a ton of batteries included so to speak, which means they have a lot of the modules that we're going to be using. Modules are pre-written code that we can import and use so we don't have to write a hundred thousand lines of code to do machine learning, for example.

For the newcomer to Python, modules can be a bit of a pain to acquire. Using Quantopian eliminates this pain completely.

We also want to use Quantopian because their back-testing simulation is very noob friendly. Quantopian is built on top of python, a bunch of other modules, and a module called Zipline, which is a back-testing module for Python. Zipline can be used outside of Quantopian, so you can learn with Quantopian and then protect your algorithm if you wanted to by moving off their website, but, for now, it will make things extremely simple.

Quantopian also has a ton of high quality data that we can use. Normally, you will need to go and acquire this data somehow. There are some really great data resources out there, but Quantopian makes this super easy too.

If the globals dictionary is present and lacks ‘__builtins__’, the current globals are copied into globals before expression is parsed. This means that expression normally has full access to the standard builtins module and restricted environments are propagated. If the locals dictionary is omitted it defaults to the globals dictionary. If both dictionaries are omitted, the expression is executed in the environment where eval() is called. The return value is the result of the evaluated expression. Syntax errors are reported as exceptions.

2Tw39kZIbhs,sentdex,Python Pickle Module for saving objects (serialization),"This Python programming tutorial covers how to pickle objects in Python. 

The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” [1] or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

Examples of this might be loading a massive dataset into memory, some basic pre-processing of a static dataset, or, like in our case, the training of a classifier. 

In our case, we spend much time on training our classifier, and soon we may add more. It is a wise choice to go ahead and pickle the trained classifer. This way, we can load in the trained classifier in a matter of milliseconds, rather than waiting 3-5+ minutes for the classifier to be trained. 

To do this, we use the standard library's ""pickle"" module. What pickle does is serialize, or de-serialize, python objects. This could be lists, dictionaries, or even things like our trained classifier!

Aside from tense, and even one of these is a noun, they all have the same meaning for their ""root"" stem (read).

This way, we store one single value for the root stem of ""read.""

My assertion is that you cannot beat the odds. We'll use programming to see!

TNXEqYCvf8U,sentdex,Elite: Dangerous with the Oculus Rift DK2 Review,"Welcome to my review of the Oculus Rift DK2 with Elite: Dangerous. 

The Oculus Rift is a Virtual Reality headset, and Elite: Dangerous is a massive online game, still in beta at the time of my filming this. 

Elite: Dangerous was clearly made with the Oculus Rift and VR in mind, as there are many little additions and changes to the game when you use the headset. Targeting is done by looking at the target rather than needing to point your ship right at it and menus pop up when you look in their direction, rather than needing to press a key. 

The cockpit feels very genuine and the immersion is superb. E:D is definitely a great game with or without the Oculus Rift, but, there is no question: The Oculus Rift dramatically improves the game. 

Yes, on the DK2, the resolution is a bit grainy, making small text hard to read at times, requiring you to lean in to read it, but, aside from reading text, I find myself completely forgetting about the grainy resolution. It is highly likely this will not be the case in the consumer edition of the Oculus Rift as well. 

If you're interested in space combat, then this is a no-brainer!

In this tutorial series, we're going to be covering with more depth the Tkinter module, which is built into Python. We're going to be using Python 3 specifically here, but you should be able to follow along in Python 2 as well.

Tkinter is a Python wrapper about Tcl, which is a graphical user interface development toolkit. 

In this video, we introduce the topic and our goals. Here, we're going to make a Bitcoin trading application as an example. This application will have multiple pages, live graphs, trade execution, and more. You will not need bitcoin or a bitcoin account to do this tutorial.

In this Flask tutorial video, we cover the extending capability of Flask Templates. The idea of extending is to allow for custom templates ""within"" other templates. So, you will generally have something like your header and footer in your main template, with things like your navbar, logo/banner, and then your footer information. Then, in the body area, you have the body data actually coming from another template that ""extends"" the main template.

For this tutorial, we’re going to use Highcharts. I’ve used these for a few years now, and I have been very happy with them. They are still in active development as well. Just like Bootstrap, after you begin using these, you’ll probably start to notice just how many people use this graphing application!

In this Flask tutorial, we're going to be talking about how to pass logic from Python to HTML, incorporate templates, and variables. Logic actually ends up being more like having logic in our HTML. We can do things like having For loops and if statements in our Python. 

Passing variables from our Flask Python files to HTML is fairly simple, and using Templates can save us a lot of time.

Something like for each element in a list, place in a table, is completely possible.

We also cover using try-except for error handling. It can be useful to have the exceptions logging the errors in a log file at the very least.

Hello and welcome to my introduction to Flask. Flask is a web framework for the Python programming language. A lot of people are curious to know what the differences of Flask and other developmental frameworks, especially compared to the Python frameworks. 

In this video, we cover what Flask is and how it compares to other frameworks, then we talk about how we set up our development server. We are going to be using a real server here for development, not a local setup. 

We do this because, if you are trying to learn web development, then you must be interested in a live, real website. The problem with working on a local instance is then you have to transfer everything to an actual server. You will find very quickly that things work very different when you leave your home computer. 

Hosts that I recommend:

digitalocean.com: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d1c4c6e66979  (use these guys if you want just a small, cheap server $5/mo)

linode.com: https://www.linode.com/?r=b417bc672ff52d6c055fd7a56e024939c667b0fd (use these guys if you think your website will get more than 1k visitors a day, I prefer Linode to DO.)

pythonanywhere.com (use these guys for super easy setup, not recommended, however, for their downtimes, and some access restrictions as compared to your typical server.)

ujOTNg17LjI,sentdex,Game Development in Python 3 With PyGame - 1 - Intro,"In this video, we introduce how to make video games with the Python programming language and the PyGame module to make video games. Python makes for a great programming language to use when learning game development because of its simple syntax. 

Learning game development is also a great way to learn how to program. Video games usually incorporate mathematics, physics , sometimes artificial intelligence, and a lot of logic. Most importantly, they can be an enjoyable way to learn all of this.

Now the installation for Pygame from one of the websites shared uses wheel (whl) files instead of executables. To install the wheel file:

Download the .whl that matches your python version and bit version. Once downloaded:

Either use this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnpC_Ib_lbc

or..

Extract the .whl file, you should see a ""pygame"" directory. If you do not have a program that can extract it, use something like 7-zip.

Move the Pygame directory to:
C:/Python34/Lib/site-packages/

The downside here is that your efficiency in processing will be limited to how efficient you have written your code. If there is a way to do it in Pandas, you should try to do it with a tool they have provided to maintain speed, but, you can always use this method as a last resort to do exactly what you need.

pkNJdko-9zI,sentdex,Pandas with Python 2.7 Part 3 - Reading from and saving to CSV,"Greetings and welcome to Part 3 of our Pandas tutorial series with Python 2.7. In this video, we cover reading from a CSV as well as writing to a CSV file. CSV files are very popularly requested to be read, so it only makes sense that Pandas makes this easy for us. Not only is reading and writing with CSV files easy in Pandas, but manipulating them as objects is easy and very powerful.

pt85jGDGFtU,sentdex,Pandas with Python 2.7 Part 6 - Data visualization with Matplotlib,"One of the most powerful aspects of Pandas is it's easy inclusion into the Matplotlib module. Matplotlib is a popular and robust Python module that allows programmers to create graphs and charts from their data. Pandas makes loading your data into Matplotlib slightly easier, as well as handles almost all of the processing necessary to get it ready for Matplotlib. Pandas is basically created to do this in the most efficient way possible. Pandas is also quite remarkably good at working with data with dates and Matplotlib. Traditionally, working with data that is indexed by date is somewhat challenging with Matplotlib, but not when using Pandas!

qtQh2C5dzRo,sentdex,Pandas with Python 2.7 Part 1 - Downloading and dependencies,"Welcome to the introduction of my Pandas module tutorial video. The Pandas module is a massive collaboration of many modules along with some unique features to make a very powerful module. Pandas is great for data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. Here, we cover downloading and installing the module and the various dependencies for it. 

This will likely be the last series I cover in Python 2.7. I've had it done for a while, but wanted to move to Python 3.3. I think it can still be helpful, so I've decided to release it anyways. I hope some of you find it to be useful.

4FrQaowzIGo,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Tkinter event handling,"In this tutorial, we cover tkinter event handling. In this scenario, we are adding a quit event to our quit button. In basically every circumstance, we're going to want to have our buttons actually do something or perform an action. This is called an event, and we can write code to handle events. In tkinter, this is as simple as adding a command, which we'll make into a function. Even though this function is a basic 1-line function that simply calls another function, we can see how we can later create more complex functions for our events.

As we saw, initially, when you use Python 3 and urllib to parse a website, you get all of the HTML data, like using ""view source"" on a web page. This HTML data is great if you are viewing via a browser, but is incredibly messy if you are viewing the raw source. For this reason, we need to build something that can sift through the mess and just pull the article data that we are interested in.

To many this is a confusing concept, but it is pretty simple and very useful once you learn it. The idea of sys.argv is to allow you to pass arguments through to Python from the command line. 

This ability acts as a bridge to the ability to communicate between Python and other languages.

RVXIBZvg-W8,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Lists and Tuples,"In this programming tutorial, we cover Python lists and tuples. 

Both data structures contain data, but are slightly different. Python lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed and manipulated. Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. This is what sets them apart and why you would use a specific one. Lists are usually more popular, since people want to be able to change them, but tuples are also useful when you do not want or need to change the data. 

It should also be noted that Tuples are faster to process and iterate through, so this gives them a bonus, again, if you are not needing to manipulate them.

In this video we exhibit our basic autonomous raspberry pi robot car. All of the car's wheel movements are random, and the only change to the random-ness is when the front ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) detects that an object is too close. When this occurs, the robot car automatically will reverse.

We programmed in a failsafe as well that if reverse does not work, a pivot will be attempted, more reversing, and, if all else fails, shutdown. Worked better than expected, so that's nice.

In this video we cover the code necessary for turning our Raspberry Pi robot car into a somewhat autonomous robot that moves around and avoids objects. To do this, we have an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor on the front, which will notify our car whenever we are close to running into an object. From here, we program the car to handle these events.

In this case, we are using BTC-e's Trade API, though the trade APIs are all relatively similar. From here, you can use Python to create further logic to execute trades for you. From here, you can automatically trade Bitcoin, Litecoin, and more algorithmically based on programming logic. 

All viewers should understand that this is live trading, and any mistakes or poor decisions can result in the loss of some or all of their cryptocurrencies or fiat money. Be careful! Also take note that you are trusting a 3rd party with your bitcoin here. Do not put money on any exchange or with any 3rd party that you cannot afford to lose.

Bu0kpU-ozaw,sentdex,How to use IBPy Python with Interactive Brokers TWS API For Automated Trading,"This tutorial covers how to use the IBPy Python programming module with Interactive Broker's Trader Workstation API (TWS API). We assume that Python is already installed on your machine. If not, head over to: https://www.python.org/download/ and download Python 2.7!

The API is intended for Java, though the IBPy module is a Python wrapper around the Java API which allows us to use Python. 

This tutorial will teach you how to actually execute an order through the TWS API. We cover installation of IBPy as well as TWS. We also show what settings you need to modify in TWS to allow for automated trading. From here, we cover how to execute both a market order for stocks as well as a limit order.

In this python tutorial video, we take our raspberry pi robot car, and we add the HC SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to it. The idea of the distance sensor is to relay some waves out, time how long it takes for them to come back, and, then, using the known constant of the speed of sound, we can derive the distance of the object that the sound bounced off of.

In this case, we use Tkinter to log key input from the user. This is notably not the most efficient way to do it, so, if you feel you have a better way, feel free. It'd be nice to control it via the shell, but that cannot work when using Tkinter. 

Since this isn't my main end-goal, I am not too focused on solving this one via python, but feel free to share if you know a better way via python.

In this video we take our raspberry pi robotic car and add two more possibilities to it: Pivot left and pivot right. The reason why we might want our remote controlled car be able to pivot is just in case we do not want to gain as much forward ground as a regular turn would require. 

From here, we are ready to add user input to the car to actually control it. That is what our next video will cover.

Our goal is to use this setup to enable the car to go forward, backwards, turn, and pivot. We'll see how that goes!

Greetings and welcome to the second part of our robotics with python and the raspberry pi! In this video, the basic assembly is shown for how to hook up our pi to the l298n controller, battery pack, and motors. 

After the initial hooking up, you are shown an extremely basic python script that will make the motor run momentarily and then stop. As we continue, we will build slightly more complex code, and get the motors to work with each other.

UKXx4e9PotI,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Installing modules,"At this point, you've got all the basics necessary to start employing modules.

We still have to teach classes, among a few other necessary basics, but now would be a good time to talk about modules.

IF you are using linux, installing Python modules is incredibly stupid easy. For programming, linux is just lovely when it comes to installing packages for just about whatever. I believe mac allows similar treatment, though I've not done it myself.

When I was first starting out with Python, installing modules was one of the most difficult things, for a few reasons. Mainly, with windows, there are quite a few methods for installation of modules. you've got pip install setuptools, download and click'n'drag, or setup.py

At the time of starting Python, a large part of my troubles was that I didn't actually understand the process of getting a module, and this is obviously very frustrating.

Python is going to look in a few places for modules.

That's going to be site-packages and the script's directory for the most part. There are some other places you can use, but let's leave them out of it. Knowing this allows you yourself to make your own modules, in the form of just a script if you want, putting that in the same directory as your main script, and then using import to bring it on board, you can also place multiple scripts in a dir and use that. Once you begin to familiarize yourself with this, and understand how and why things work, it will help you a lot.

If you use append, then you will basically add to whatever is previously there. I will be showing both methods, but write first.

AWIgW_F_k50,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Common errors,"In this video we'll be discussing some of the basics to debugging. In my videos, I get a lot of questions for help where people have errors and are not sure what the problem is. If they used some extremely simple debugging, they'd realize how obvious the answer is. Most of the time, the problem is a typo, followed closely by a misunderstanding of indentation and standards.

Standards how are how you organize your code. With python, unlike most languages, you define blocks of code, like functions, by indentation. Most python editors will automatically indent for you where it is necessary. With this, if you are ever coding along and find python automatically indenting you where you don't think it should, this should raise a flag for you to figure out.

There are some more in-depth common-issues that you'll find from time to time, you can find more debugging videos by searching for debugging in my channel. For now I will just keep these ones basic. The first error we'll discuss is the NameError: is not defined.

As obvious as this might appear to you, this gets people amazingly frequently. Just learn to recognize the ""is not defined"" as a high chance that you have typoed the definition of the variable or when you are calling it. Basically, you typo-ed somewhere.

r9LtArXOYjk,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Global and Local Variables,"Welcome to another python 3 basics video, in this video we're going to now discuss the concept of global and local variables.

When users begin using functions, they can quickly become confused when it comes to global and local variables... getting a the dreaded variable is not defined even when they clearly see that it is... or so they think.

These terms of global and local correspond to a variable's reach within a script or program. A global variable is one that can be accessed anywhere. A local variable is the opposite, it can only be accessed within its frame. The difference is that global variables can be accessed locally, but not modified locally inherently.

A local variable cannot be accessed globally, inherently. Now, dont worry about committing that to memory right now, I think it makes a lot more sense when you just see and do it, so let's do that.

KeRxe9rll2Q,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - Function Parameter Defaults,"In the last tutorial, we explained what function parameters were, and that we could have an infinite amount of them. With this, we explained how having a lot of them could become troublesome and tedious for the programmer using the function. Luckily, there is a solution for this. Sometimes, it can make a lot of sense to make a complex function highly customize-able. That said, some people may want to use the function in it's simple... ""default"" ... form. Think about it like buying a car. Some people want to just buy the base model, with all the features that come by default from the factory. Other people want to customize their car in many different ways. Luckily, we allow people who want to customize their car the option to do it, but we do not ask every buyer of every car what kind of wheels they want, what brand of tire, what screws they want, what kind of leather seats by what brand, what windshield, what steering wheel, what lights... etc. This is just too much for some people and what they want to use the car for. Same goes for functions in programming.

So we have function parameter defaults, which allow the function's creator to set ""default"" values to the function parameters. This allows anyone to use a function with the default values, yet lets anyone who wishes to customize them the ability to specify different values.

When using defaults, any parameters with defaults should be the last ones listed in the function's parameters.

You can think of it a lot like why you choose to write and save a program, rather than writing out the entire program every time you want to execute it.

To begin a function, the keyword 'def' is used to notify python of the impending function definition, which is what def stands for. From there, you type out the name you want to call your function. It is important to choose a unique name, and also one that wont conflict with any other functions you might be using. For example, you wouldn't want to go calling your function print.

We use the monte carlo simulator to calculate possible paths, as well as to calculate preferred variables to use including wager size, how many wagers, and more. 

There are many purposes for a monte carlo simulator. Some people use them as a form of brute force to solve complex mathematical equations. A popular example used is to have a monte carlo simulator solve for pi. In our case, we are using the Monte Carlo simulator to account for randomness and the degree of risk associated with a betting strategy. In the world of stock trading and investing, people can use the Monte Carlo simulator to test a given strategy's risk. 

It used to be very much the case that only performance was considered, for the most part, to decide on a trader's value. Only until recently has the paradigm shifted to consider a strategy's risk more closely. Through this series, you will be able to see just how much random variability can affect the outcome, regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" a strategy might have been.

It used to be very much the case that only performance was considered, for the most part, to decide on a trader's value. Only until recently has the paradigm shifted to consider a strategy's risk more closely. Through this series, you will be able to see just how much random variability can affect the outcome, regardless of how ""good"" or ""bad"" a strategy might have been.

In this video, we begin creating our ""roll dice"" function.

In the monte carlo simulation with Python series, we test various betting strategies. A simple 50/50 strategy, a martingale strategy, and the d'alembert strategy. We use the monte carlo simulator to calculate possible paths, as well as to calculate preferred variables to use including wager size, how many wagers, and more. 

There are many purposes for a monte carlo simulator. Some people use them as a form of brute force to solve complex mathematical equations. A popular example used is to have a monte carlo simulator solve for pi.

Welcome to the next step in our parallel programming and high performance computing series. In this video, you are shown how to program your own basic MPI script. Still very similar to the things we've already seen, though this time you are the one to have made it. That said, aside from ""output"" coming through the main node, it does not really appear as though any messages have been passed or shared. In the next video, we will actually utilize MPI to pass messages.

In this Bitcoin protocol tutorial video, the notion of Proof of Work is discussed. The idea of proof of work, normally, is to protect against spam and DoS attacks. With bitcoin, however, it is used to secure the blockchain, requiring that someone must re-do large amounts of computer processing to fake things in the blockchain. 

In the next video, you will be shown, via raw code, how Proof of Work actually works. This should help clear any confusion if you are confused at that point.

In this short video, the Bitcoin timestamp server / global ledger is discussed. As usual, however, we present ourselves with an ending challenge which is to be covered in the, you guessed it, next video!

The idea of the global ledger / timestamp server is so that everyone can share a log of all transactions that have occurred, and so that every node (computer) is aware of the the status of the network.

In this Bitcoin Protocol tutorial video, the Transactions section of the Bitcoin protocol paper is explained. Of course, however, with this proposed solution, we have another issue. We can for sure confirm that a user owns or at least owned a coin, and we can confirm the chain of owners, but we cannot confirm just yet that this coin was not double spent. Have no fear, this is coming!

My argument is that Bitcoin is already plenty regulated using pre-existing rules and regulation that have indeed been used successfully to bring real criminals to justice. There does need to be some sort of *legislation* regarding bitcoin, and its use, so large businesses can do proper business with banks, but *regulation* is not actually necessary.

In this video miniseries, the original Bitcoin paper is broken down. The paper is extremely condensed and is not very friendly to people who are not very familiar with the field. Since Bitcoin is for everyone, not just computer scientists and cryptologists, it is important than anyone can understand the basics of how Bitcoin and its protocol works as well as the problems it solves. It is my goal to help anyone confused about how the Bitcoin system works, and break it down so it can be understood by anyone. I may eventually cover mining as well specifically, but it is more important that most people understand the protocol and how it works as a system.

42MBMSOZgD4,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial: If Elif Else,"Now we bring the in ""elif"" statement. The elif allows us to tie multiple if statements together as we might have intended to before with multiple if statements before we learned that the else will only be contingent on the if statement above it.

The ""elif"" statement is a hybrid of the else and the if. The way it works is:

We ask if something is the case. If it is, then the elif and the else will not run. If it is not, then the elif will run and question the if statement. If it is True, then it will run and the else will not run. If it is not true, then the else statement will run.

xtXexPSfcZg,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial - For loop,"The next loop is the For loop. The idea of the for loop is to ""iterate"" through something. For each thing in that something, it will do a block of code. Most often, you will a for loop's structure very much like

for eachThing in thisThing:
    do this stuff
    in this block
So, again, why would someone use each type of loop?

Typically, you will see the while loop being used for finite tasks that have predetermined length, and the for loop being used for tasks that have uncertain and variable time-frames.

That said, the for loop can be used for the exact same tasks as the while loop.

For this reason, I prefer the for loop myself, but again, it comes down to personal preference.

vKqVnr0BEJQ,sentdex,Python 3 Programming Tutorial: Variables,"In almost every single Python program you write, you will have variables. Variables act as placeholders for data. They can aid in short hand, as well as with logic, as variables can change, hence their name.

Variables help programs become much more dynamic, and allow a program to always reference a value in one spot, rather than the programmer needing to repeatedly type it out, and, worse, change it if they decide to use a different definition for it.

Variables can be called just about whatever you want. You wouldn't want them to conflict with function names, and they also cannot start with a number.

UsCQXe1OHZk,sentdex,Python 3 Tutorial: Print Function and Strings,"The print function in Python is a function that outputs to your console window whatever you say you want to print out. At first blush, it might appear that the print function is rather useless for programming, but it is actually one of the most widely used functions in all of python. The reason for this is that it makes for a great debugging tool. If something isn't acting right, you can use the print function to print out what is happening in the program. Many times, you expect a certain variable to be one thing, but you cannot see what the program sees. If you print out the variable, you might see that what you thought was, was not.

Next up, strings, what are they? Strings are just ""strings"" of text, hence the name. Strings are a type of data. Another type of data is integers.

Everyone starts as a beginner. Hopefully I can help many of you out of that stage! Many people know they want to learn to program, but they are not sure which language to go with or where to start. Python is often chosen by beginners due to its ""high level"" nature. ""High level"" might make it sound like it is more complex or something, though it means the opposite. Python's syntax and other structuring is very simplistic and easy for even a beginner to follow. Many people find that they can actually read and understand what is going on with non-obfuscated Python code, even if they have no knowledge of Python or programming.

Python is certainly one of the top languages for its use, and has been referred to as the ""second best language for anything."" You can use Python for web development, data analysis, robotics, games, AI, and a whole lot more.

If you're looking to acquire the superpower of programming, I am here to help! If you stick around here enough, you'll find out that I like to belittle problems. Every major problem or goal can be broken down into parts. Learning to program is a massive undertaking. It can be extremely daunting for someone who is new to it. Luckily, the task of learning how to program can be broken down as well. Most programs are just combinations of a small handful of tools and operations built together to do awesome things. This is usually some if-statements in a few functions with a few loops and, boom, program! Let's take those baby steps.

In this tutorial, you are shown how to install Python 3, as well as how to maintain installations of both Python 2 and Python 3. When I was making this video, Python 3.4 beta was out, so the most current version might be 3.4. Downloading that will be fine and the tutorial information will be identical.

Choosing a version of python can be hard, especially as a noob, since you wish to have the proper support and documentation to learn. Python 2, however, seems to be a sort of ""rut"" that people, myself included, easily get stuck in. Hopefully we can change that and help the Python language move forward.

INf7VUHUpjk,sentdex,How to modify data granularity in Python for Graphing data in Matplotlib or another application,"This tutorial video covers how to modify your data granularity. Granularity in graphs refers to the level of detail they contain. Usually, the higher the granularity, the better the quality of the data is. That said, once you pass a certain point, say 10,000 plots on a single graph, the eye can not tell the difference and processing is wasted. Instead, developers should program into their applications granularity adjustments depending on the window that a user is looking. 

This will show you how to modify how many plots are actually shown on the graph, by averaging them in groups and only plotting up those averages. This will allow you to plot high granularity data sets without waiting for an hour for them to actually generate! They are not moving averages, so there is not lag in the line either, and all data is calculated backwards.

Sample code and sample data can be found: http://pythonprogramming.net/modifying-data-granularity-matplotlib/

This is an tutorial for using MySQL with the Python programming language and the MySQLdb import. This video covers how to create a table and how to insert data. Say you are creating a forum, for example. Each post a user makes will need to be stored somewhere. In this case, we could assume it is a MySQL database. Later, we will cover how to retrieve and read the data from the database to show it on the page.

A MySQL database covers everything within it. Within a database, you have an assortment of tables. Within tables, you have rows and columns that make up something very similar to what a spreadsheet is.

hbL_FTEZSyY,sentdex,Image Recognition and Python Part 1,"Sample code for this series: http://pythonprogramming.net/image-recognition-python/

There are many applications for image recognition. One of the largest that people are most familiar with would be facial recognition, which is the art of matching faces in pictures to identities. Image recognition goes much further, however. It can allow computers to translate written text on paper into digital text, it can help the field of machine vision, where robots and other devices can recognize people and objects.

Here, our goal is to begin to use machine learning, in the form of pattern recognition, to teach our program what text looks like. In this case, we'll use numbers, but this could translate to all letters of the alphabet, words, faces, really anything at all. The more complex the image, the more complex the code will need to become. When it comes to letters and characters, it is relatively simplistic, however.

How is it done? Just like any problem, especially in programming, we need to just break it down into steps, and the problem will become easily solved. Let's break it down!

First, we know we want to show the program an image, and have it compare it to patterns that it knows to make an educated guess on what the current image is. This means we're going to need some ""memory"" of sorts, filled with examples. In the case of this tutorial, we'd like to do image recognition for the numbers zero through nine. So we'd like to be able to show it any random 2, and have it know the image to be a 2 based on the previous examples of 2's that it has seen and memorized.

Next, we need to consider how we'll do this. A computer doesn't read text like we read text. We naturally put things together into a pattern, but a machine just reads the data. In the case of a picture, it reads in the image data, and displays, pixel by pixel, what it is told to display. Past that, a machine makes no attempt to decide whether it is showing a couch or a bird. So, our database of what examples are will actually be pixel information. To keep things simple, we should probably ""threshold"" the images. This means we store everything as black or white. In RGB code, that's a 255, 255, 255, or 0, 0, 0. That is per pixel. Sometimes there is alpha too! What we can then do is take any image, and, if the pixel coloring is say greater than 125, we could say, this is more of a ""white"" and convert it to 255 (the entire pixel). If it is less than 125 or equal to it, we could say this is more of a ""black"" and convert it to black. This might be problematic in some circumstances where we have a dark color on a darker color, usually a type of image meant to fool machines. We could have something in place instead to find the ""middle"" color on average for the current image, and threshold anything lighter to white and anything darker to black. This works very well for two-dimensional images of things like characters, but less well for things with shading that are meant to accompany the image, say of something like a ball.

Once we've done this, all we need to do is save the string of pixel definitions for a bunch of ""example"" texts. We can start with a bunch of fonts, plus some hand drawn examples. There are data dumps of a bunch of examples. This is an example of ""training"" our data.

If we have a decently sized database, then we are ready to try to compare some numbers. A good idea would be to hand-draw an example for your program to compare to. To compare, we'd just simply do the same thing to the question-image. We'd threshold the image into black or white pixels, then we take that pixel list, and compare it to all of our examples. In the end, we will have so many possible ""hits."" Whichever character has the most ""hits"" is likely to be the correct one. Done, we've recognized that image.

If you think about it, this is actually very similar to how we humans recognize things. Naturally, many children do not immediately distinguish between couches and love seats. What is the difference many of them ask. There is a bit of a grey area between them, and they have many similarities. Generally, a lot of learning comes by example. After seeing hundreds of couches, thousands of chairs, and hundreds of love-seats, a person soon begins to easily distinguish between them, because they have quite a bit of sample data to compare to. This is even how we read text. A number 5 really does mean nothing to a baby. They only begin to learn what a number 5 is as they are shown it over and over, being told it is ""5."" Eventually, they understand that to be a 5, and they can see 5 in multiple font types and still recognize it to be a 5.

In this tutorial with Basemap, you are shown how to actually plot a plot, as well as choose a zoom level on your projection. As you can see, plotting lat and long coordinates is fairly simple if you envision them as X and Y on a plane. The only confusing part is that X, Y translates to Lon, Lat... which is the reverse of how they are normally reported.

In this series, you are taught how to plot on a map with python and do geographical plotting with the matplotlib extension called basemap.

Now that you are pretty much a pro at all other things Matplotlib, it is time to learn how to spread your wings a bit and begin working with geo-plotting on maps, using basemap. Basemap works alongside Matplotlib to allow you to plot via latitude and longitude coordinates.

Once you have basemap installed, you can use the following code to quickly show a simple map. This will just render and display a map, but soon we'll be plotting, zooming, and more fun things!

The Raspberry Pi is a mini-computer that is capable of all kinds of things. You can turn it into a personal computer, use it to control robots, use it as a server, and a whole lot more. Many people compare this to the Arduino, but it is important to note that they are two totally different things. The Arduino is just a controller, the Raspberry Pi is a full computer.

Basically, the ""thickness"" of the bars is also define-able. For most, this will be simply a pre-determined set of data, but you can actually use this for one more ""dimension"" to your plot.

Sometimes people want to plot a scatter plot and compare different datasets to see if there is any similarities. Here, you are shown how to chart two sets of data and how to specifically mark them and color them differently.

The following sample code utilizes the Axes3D function of matplot3d in Matplotlib. We use two sample sets, each with their own X Y and Z data. From here, we use .scatter to plot them up, 'c' to reference color and 'marker' to reference the shape of the plot marker.

http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcTDEowl-b5nQlaDaD82r_s

Python is one of the most popular and growing languages, and was somewhat lacking in the web development arena for a while. Eventually, multiple web frame works began to appear, and Django became the most popular. There are many others, such as Flask, web2py, and bottle. Each framework has its own characteristics and should be considered depending on your project.

Django, Flask, and web2py are all great options. Django is the largest and most supported, so if you happen to learn by example, this might be the best choice. Django also just seems to have more documentation. Flask and web2py are both slightly more basic at their core. web2py doesn't require much at all, which is why many prefer it. Django forces you into having a semi-complex website, where web2py does not. Flask is somewhere in the middle. That said, you can make very simple websites with Django, and very complex websites with web2py.

If you intend to have a content-management-driven website with a significant database, then Django should definitely be considered. If you want to go with Django, then this tutorial series might just be for you. In this series, we create a simple blog-like website, do some basic HTML5 design, and show how to add python code in the back ground and display the return of any script. In our case, the return is the outputted Matplotlib graph that our backend script creates. Below is a picture of the finished product.
