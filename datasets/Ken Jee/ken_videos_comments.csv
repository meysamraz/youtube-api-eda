I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.""]"

I like learning and  taking challenges.\nMy current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming...\nYour sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition.

Even the comments sections in your videos are insightful."", 'one of the best data science channels out there.. kia kaha tonu..keep going', 'Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?\n\n\nPerhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? \n\n\nThe curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc.\n\nThink critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.', ""Hi Ken\nGreat content as usual\nMay I have some recommendations or suggestions from you?\nI'm in my graduate study on modeling fish population dynamics.

I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again.

Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.\n2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don\'t have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it\'s rather inefficient.\n3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!\n4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it\'s like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don\'t change as often.\n5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.\n\n\nMy resolutions:\n1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.\n2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.\n3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren\'t data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)\n4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML\n5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert\n6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don\'t have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what\'s going on in our field)\n7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I\'ve been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I\'ll be able to make it useful soon!\n\n\nThank you for an interesting and relatable video!', 'My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall.

I could be wrong tho."", 'As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something  like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.', ""Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket.  With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.\n\n\nThe NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix."", '#GoodTalk']"
