vFZ5rtf71WU,Krish Naik,Tutorial 9- MYSQL Stored Procedures -MySQL Complete Playlist,"What is a SQL Stored Procedure?
The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it. Users can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given.

xDDlB51dX5E,Krish Naik,Tutorial 6- Indexing In MySQL-MySQL Complete Playlist,"CREATE INDEX statement in SQL is used to create indexes in tables. 
The indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than others.
The user can not see the indexes, and they are just used to speed up queries /searches.
Note: Updating the table with indexes takes a lot of time than updating a table without indexes.
It is because the indexes also need an update. 
So, only create indexes on those columns that will be frequently searched against.

TH8ntzkdtLk,Krish Naik,What Is Smart Contract In Ethereum Blockchain?,"""smart contract"" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.
Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.

0JuRzN6T70I,Krish Naik,Tutorial 1- What Is Blockchain?,"KEY TAKEAWAYS
Blockchain is a specific type of database.
It differs from a typical database in the way it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then chained together. 
As new data comes in it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain but the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions. 
In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control—rather, all users collectively retain control.
Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.

darts is a Python library for easy manipulation and forecasting of time series. It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to deep neural networks. The models can all be used in the same way, using fit() and predict() functions, similar to scikit-learn. The library also makes it easy to backtest models, and combine the predictions of several models and external regressors. Darts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models. The neural networks can be trained on multiple time series, and some of the models offer probabilistic forecasts.","['yt:cc=on', 'krish naik machine learning', 'krish naik deep learning', 'darts library', 'time series forecasting']",2021-09-25T15:38:20Z,28096,997,,61,PT11M37S,hd,false

V1-Hm2rNkik,Krish Naik,Tutorial 2- Fine Tuning Pretrained Model On Custom Dataset Using 🤗 Transformer,"github: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Huggingfacetransformer
In this tutorial, we will show you how to fine-tune a pretrained model from the Transformers library. In TensorFlow, models can be directly trained using Keras and the fit method. In PyTorch, there is no generic training loop so the 🤗 Transformers library provides an API with the class Trainer to let you fine-tune or train a model from scratch easily.

y9AK1YKRoLg,Krish Naik,Complete Road Map Towards Data Science In 2021,"According to the Harvard Business Review, Data Scientist is “The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”. Is this not enough to know more about data science! In the world of data space, the era of Big Data emerged when organizations are dealing with petabytes and exabytes of data. It became very tough for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when popular frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus is on processing the data. And here Data Science plays a big role. Nowadays the growth of data science has been increased in various ways and so one should be ready for the future by learning what data science is and how can we add value to it.

3fzYdnuvEfk,Krish Naik,All Type Of Cross Validation With Python All In 1 Video,"https://github.com/krishnaik06/Types-Of-Cross-Validation
Building machine learning models is an important element of predictive modeling. However, without proper model validation, the confidence that the trained model will generalize well on the unseen data can never be high. Model validation helps in ensuring that the model performs well on new data, and helps in selecting the best model, the parameters, and the accuracy metrics.

In this guide, we will learn the basics and implementation of several model validation techniques, mentioned below:
#crossvalidation
Hold Out Validation
K-fold Cross-Validation.
Stratified K-fold Cross-Validation
Leave One Out Cross-Validation.
Repeated Random Test-Train Splits

Using PyWebIO, developers can write applications just like writing terminal scripts (interaction based on input and print), without the need to have knowledge of HTML and JS. PyWebIO can also be easily integrated into existing Web services. PyWebIO is very suitable for quickly building applications that do not require complex UI.

R3zi7kSRuuI,Krish Naik,Tutorial 4- Julia For Data Science-String In Julia Along With Indepth Functions,"github: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Julia-Programming-With-MAchine-Learning
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science
Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding[clarification needed][20] to ""OpenMP-style"" threads), 
and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as ""just-ahead-of-time"" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on default settings) to machine code before running it.

Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science
Distinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with parametric polymorphism in a dynamic programming language; with multiple dispatch as its core programming paradigm. Julia supports concurrent, (composable) parallel and distributed computing (with or without using MPI and/or the built-in corresponding[clarification needed][20] to ""OpenMP-style"" threads), 
and direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code. Julia uses a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that is referred to as ""just-ahead-of-time"" (JAOT) in the Julia community, as Julia compiles (on default settings) to machine code before running it.

UbvkhuqVqUI,Krish Naik,Lets Implement LSTM RNN Models For Univariate Time Series Forecasting- Deep Learning,"In this tutorial, we will explore how to develop a suite of different types of LSTM models for time series forecasting.

The models are demonstrated on small contrived time series problems intended to give the flavor of the type of time series problem being addressed. The chosen configuration of the models is arbitrary and not optimized for each problem; that was not the goal.

Automation makes running a business more efficient on one hand, and on the other, it keeps on changing the skill set required to stay relevant in the industry.

This inevitably leads to unemployment due to mismatches in the skill set. Let me take you through a few scenarios to illustrate my thoughts.

Um0cULrwBlA,Krish Naik,Free Data Science Project Architecture And Resume Building Sessions- Giving Back To DS Community,"Registeration link: https://ineuron1.viewpage.co/ArchitectureDesignResumeBuilding
Hello Everyone,
Today we are going to launch one more ‘giving back to the community’ initiative. So far, in our experience while providing training for data science and while interviewing candidates, we have observed that one of  the things which is most lacking is the intuition and experience to build an end to end machine learning pipeline and architecture.
Hence, we are launching this initiative to discuss various architectures catering to almost all the software industry domains. Here, we will drill down to the nitty-gritty of building a software solution from scratch and discuss various ways to make it scalable and robust. Moreover, we’ll also talk about building your resumes for data science job roles based on your experience and the industry domain that you work in.

NAPhUDjgG_s,Krish Naik,Tutorial 28-MultiCollinearity In Linear Regression- Part 2,"In regression, ""multicollinearity"" refers to predictors that are correlated with other predictors. Multicollinearity occurs when your model includes multiple factors that are correlated not just to your response variable, but also to each other. In other words, it results when you have factors that are a bit redundant

This type of recommender system is dependent on the inputs provided by the user. Some of the typical examples of content based filtering are Google, Wikipedia etc. Let’s start by getting an intuition of what these recommenders do. When you search a group of keywords, the most basic idea will be to show all the items containing those keywords

CKLwvuKWQjo,Krish Naik,Tutorial 14- Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum,"In this post I’ll talk about simple addition to classic SGD algorithm, called momentum which almost always works better and faster than Stochastic Gradient Descent. Momentum or SGD with momentum is method which helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is one of the most popular optimization algorithms and many state-of-the-art models are trained using it. Before jumping over to the update equations of the algorithm, let’s look at some math that underlies the work of momentum.

wTF6vzS9fy4,Krish Naik,K Nearest Neighbour Easily Explained with Implementation,"In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression.[1] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:

In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.
k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.

Both for classification and regression, a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.
