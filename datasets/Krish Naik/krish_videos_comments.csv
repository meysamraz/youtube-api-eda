I have completed my degree in 2013. I have experience 5 yrs experience in teaching field. I'm 30 now.. I'm good at maths and logical skills. Can I become data analyst and get a job now? Please suggest"", 'for second project we can either use openCV   or cascade classifier  and  product recomender  by tensorflow or forcasting as well .......', 'For the 1st case\nWe use gender and age parameter and apply knn or svm', '1. Recommendation System:\nWhen a person log in, get all the information regarding the person like what product he/she likes, what does the person prefer, get the browsing history of that person. Now based on the product he/she buys, we can set item-based filtering recommendation or collaborative -based filtering. Now, to tackle the cold start problem, whenever a new person comes in for the first time, show what products does he/she likes, show the tags. Once we have the data we get specific based on tag and at least show some recommendation.\n\n2. Facial Recognition:\nFirst we have to determine what are all the range pf products available i.e.what products are available for what part of the face. We have to check if the person is male or female. Train a model or use a pretrained model which will get the facial characteristics of the face, like if it detects a beard then recommend beard oil or a trimmer. For the female recommend cream, lotion based on the marks, spots on the face. This can be done with uploaded photos or real time camera using openCV. Similarly, like the previous to tackle cold start problem, show what products he/she is interested in, show the tags, get the history etc.\n\n3. Logistic Procurement:\nThe main objective here I believe is to show whether or not we need more material or less material for the product. This is a kind of optimization problem where we are minimizing the raw materials needed. I have 2 approach for this-\n  a. First one is model based. First, we have to see what different types of juice are there to make. Based on that we have to see the material we need to build the product. We have get all the characteristics/features of the juice which contributes in using raw materials more or less. We can build a model based on those and either predict whether it will use more or less material (binary classification task) or predict what is amount of material the product is going to use (linear regression task). \n  b. The second way is based on heuristic approach. If the product use different material to to be build i.e. let say some amount of each \'n\' material to make a product. Now to minimize the amount needed for each material we can use genetic algorithm to get that or other optimization algorithm to do that.Though this not so efficient, if we have lets say 100 products each using \'n\' materials type as we have to do for all.\n\n4. Car Problem:\nThis use case is in kinda broad spectrum. I am no knowledge in car making but still answering it.\n  a. Damage Detection: A car has many parts inside and outside the body. We can separate damage detection in terms of ""analog i.e. mechanical parts and digital i.e. in software parts"".\n      i. For the damage detection in mechanical parts like brakes, engine, tires etc. we can build a model which can detect damage and do segmentation of that part. For this to happen we need to install camera inside the engine hood and underneath the car. A damage can be detected not only by images but with sensors too. The car software can analyze the data to get a warning like this parts seems fishy, kindly check it out.\n     ii. For the damage in the software parts, show warning about the software parts.\nTo make it work both side needs to work together.\n\n  b. AC control: First off sense the outside temperature via sensor, sense the inside of the car also, get the temperature from both sides, then don\'t turn on the AC immediately just show a prompt on the screen whether or not turn on the AC. Let\'s keep the action on the user part. Imagine if someone has cold inside the car and suddenly it turn on the AC, good luck. Or imagine the person doesn\'t want the AC, he/she can pull down the windows.', 'For 1st use case..we can first do clustering and segment customers into different groups and then we could apply multi-class classification based on previous data on each segment and built recommendation system based on classification results', 'First usecase...\n\nInsurance recommendation system.\nBasic details we get is age,sex,demography etc etc..\nFirst we consider it is as cold start problem and we can recommend product which are similar to age interval and demographic feature etc.\n\nAfter that we can track user serach and using that searches we can recommend user by using user user similarity or item item similarity.\n\nAlso we can cluster users and identify the nature and best recommendation also.....', 'please share the answers, approach that you used', 'Krish sir , i am confused here \nWhat is difference in Feature Scaling and Gaussian Transformation techniques (i know both are falls in Feature Scaling)\nAnd does i have to use both of them ?

BIAS is the inability of ML algorithm to capture the 100 percent or exact relationship. To understand bias one must think why do we need a ML in first place. In mathematics or physics we have absolute relationship or formula between dependent and independent variables like s=ut+1/2 at2 (std 7 Physics) or SI = P*R*T  so for computing cases like we have absolute formula we don't need any ML algo. ML try to do the same i.e. estimate a formula, let say I want to calculate the purchasing power (P) so I train a model with different variables like income,age, family income and m model fetches a formula  P = wo+ b1*income+b2*age + b3* family income..... So this formula is not absolute or universal as its derived by a specific ML algo for specific data but let say by miracle we derive a formula that exactly calculates the purchasing power with 100 percent accuracy so for that model bias is 0 as the model accurately captures the relationship..... Variance ---- Talking about variance, in short way the difference in fits between data set is called variance , imagine we used that same miracle formula in test data and data fits 100 percent as in we get 100 percent accuracy(for different test set) then we can say that the variance is 0 which means the ML formula is perfect or let say when use the same miracle formula in test set we get 50% accuracy which means the bias was low but variance is high as formula didnt work well with unseen (test) data...

Population mean is the average computed for the entire data and sample mean is the average computed for that particular sample. Therefore there would be some differences between them. the sample mean will be close to the population mean. \n\nNow coming to sample variance and population variance, the difference will be huge between the sum of the squares of the difference between data and sample mean and the sum of squares of (data - population mean). This is due to the small difference between the sample mean and population mean. When it is squared the difference is more. To compensate for the difference we use n-1 in the denominator to increase the value such that the sample variance is closer to the population variance. Why n-1 the value comes closer when we compute considering n-1 than to n-2, n-3, and others. \n\nHappy learning!!']"

Many colleges wants to show only successful alumni as if it was their training that did the magic...:)', 'Kris sir Asp.net development mei career kaisa hai long term', 'Totally agree with Krish. When people tell me these things my simple question to them is - ""Do you want to keep crying over what you didn\'t or don\'t have OR you want to make effort to make your future better?"" It\'s that simple! Whatever problem was there genuine or your excuse but it had already happened. Now, what options you have? We don\'t have a time machine yet - so can\'t go back and change things. So, the only feasible option is to do things now that will make your future better otherwise again 2 -5 years down the lane you will be crying if I had done this at that time things would have been different. This is applicable to any situation.\nYes, being in tier-1 college does help. I prefer the marathon analogy in this respect. Life is not a 100 meters race but a marathon. Being from a tier-1 college can give you, maybe, 50 meters ahead start. IF you are looking for short-term accomplishments such as the first job CTC then in most cases yes the one from tier-1 has an advantage (though not always - there are students who have done great wonders even without a proper college education).  But in long term, you have ample opportunities to overtake him/her. Though I am not a big fan of such competition - just giving an example as most people are used to compare themselves with the others. Instead of this, it will be better if we have our own goal defined be it money wise or profile wise (just talking with respect to jobs, not life in general). And there is no shame in having a money-oriented goals. I see many students/people giving philosophical answers because in Indian society we have been trained this way to be money-oriented is bad! ( in the majority of the middle class - not directly but indirectly). Anyway coming back to the original topic - being from a tier-3 college may put you 50 meters behind - so you need to put an extra effort and work hard to cover this gap. I have seen lots of students and have lots of friends from tier-1,2,3 colleges and after 8 years of jobs, now it hardly matters who came from IIT Bombay or Kharagpur or who came from LPU or VTU colleges. In fact, I have seen the other way around. One of my friend didn\'t get in very good college so he put an extra effort in off-campus and gave more than 15 interviews in a row. He didn\'t confine himself to the on-campus opportunities and this I am talking about 2011-12, now things have become much better. Yes, he started at lower ctc but his determination and hard work paid off - he learned whatever he worked on in-depth (believe me most of us in the IT industry just completes our works NOT really go in-depth of the things and understand it in and out). He switched to another company and the next switch was a big e-commerce company and his ctc was well above 20 in the first 3 years. I have various similar examples recently someone switched from ctc of 8 to 30+ in Walmart (he also doesn\'t come from tier-1 college). Anyway, the bottom line is you have to put in extra effort and have patience. \n\nSpend time working towards your goal rather than crying over what you don\'t have or didn\'t have. And if you really feel you are at disadvantage then pickup google and search or maybe just look around yourself. You will find so many people who are in much much much worse condition than yourself but still, they are not making those things stop them. I have so many examples but won\'t bore with those stories, maybe in some blog I can put all these to motivate people because people like actual anecdotes. \n\nAnd many people ask me or here also are asking - not from tech background what to do? Whoever reached out to me, I have answered them in detail as per their profile or given some references who have made similar transitions. Wil briefly mention it here else this comment will become an article! :P \nNon tech background comes in two categories:\n1> Engineering but not CS/IT\n2> Non-engineers BA,Commerce etc.\n\nSee, above is degree wise category. But what I prefer is a knowledge-wise categorization (for preparation):\n1>You know about data science and software engineering. For example one of my cousins - was in minings but he did a side project in Java. So, even though he was not from tech background he had a fair understanding of tech and had a knack for programming.\n2> You have no clue about data science but have done some small crash course in some programming language or you know some basics about coding. Mech or Civil guy who just studies \'C\' in the first sem but never opened it again. Or some commerce student (one of my friend she did a course in NIIT in Java - yes when I was in college Java was a kind of defacto language to learn) but then didn\'t practice much and became an accountant.\n3> You have no clue about the software industry, tech, programming language, etc. \n\nWhy I categorize people ethis way because it help me to suggest a feasible plan for them. I was recently talking to a girl from non-tech background falling in third category. Now, it will be unrealistic if I suggest to her that in 6 months she can be ready for a data science interview. \nOne thing I forgot - my first question to all these people especially someone who has no clue about software, DS etc.  is ""WHY?"". THE WHY is very important - why you want to transition to DS. This why tells you how much effort and passion that person has for making the shift. Many of the people reply to me \'because it\'s a hot job nowadays and getting paid handsomely\' - it is okay if you want to make a switch for money but do you really like whatever you know about DS and if you don\'t about DS then why do you want to make switch? Because like any other field - it requires dedication to excel and if you don\'t excel then you won\'t be getting that high pay for which you switched in the first place - you will get a job and will be doing good (even if you don\'t excel excel in it). If you have a strong \'why\' then it becomes easy to stick to the plan.\n\nPost these things - decide a timeline. Let\'s say 1 year. then plan to finish the syllabus by 9 months and keep the last 3 months for revising and interview prep. I have seen many people good with tech but not prepared for an interview  - they get nervous or  not able to explain in clear and concise manner or having a language barrier. And then many don\'t come prepared for the company - when you go for an interview even if it\'s just a developer role - read about that company. When asked the question do you know this company then don\'t just say not really - I have got that answer many times. Then it gives an impression you didn\'t even put an effort into knowing about the company where you are going to work then how much effort you will put in the job! So spend last 3 months searching , applying and practicing. \nPrior to that breakdown the whole syllabus into smaller milestones. Le\'s say Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning etc. Then further break it down. And keep something which you can achieve in 2 weeks. LEt\'s say you plan 2 weeks for regression - then keep 30-40% in theory and rest of the time spend in implementing what you learnt. MAke sure to add in GitHub and share on social media - LinkedIn etc. And there are various blog sites - you can write down what you learned. Benefit of this? One of my professor told me once - if you want to know if you have understood something try teaching that to someone who doesn\'t know it or to a kid and if you are able to explain it to them then that means you have really understood it. So if you write a blog - while writing only you will know your weak points and post that once published many people will read it and they can point out the mistakes too. Don\'t be afraid of making mistakes - one who makes mistakes can only correct it. One who never wrote it or tried it can never correct it. \nWhy have 2 weeks goal because that way you can track your progress quickly - if you are off the track within 2 weeks you will know and can work to fix it. If you keep big milestones such as in 3 months I will finish \'X\' syllabus then only after 3 months you will have time to fix it and also, you will get a little laid back thinking you have 3 months to complete. \n\nWhile doing all this make sure to network. Reach out to people from DS field and talk to them, and also connect with people who are making a transition similar to you. Networking helps you a lot - it\'s known and shared at many places - about 2/3 of jobs comes via referrals,connections etc. they are not put out in Naukri kind of job portal (straight away). And spend some time in preparing the syllabus for your plan don\'t just put the stuffs which are fancy but not much used in all the DS jobs for example GANs - very good and I love them but majority of DS jobs at least when you are starting doesn\'t require knowledge of GAN. So when you have limited time focus on the important topics not just fancy ones!\n\nIf you follow your plan then you can for sure achieve your goal. Just make a feasible plan and stick to it.\n\nHappy to connect over LinkedIn to help further - https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitsrivastava/', '""Whatever you are going through in life, just remember one thing...\n\n\nIt\'s all your fault""', 'Do more such videos sir', 'okay krish sir.....i feel ashamed and a sense of self realisation..............I will work more harder from now onwards', 'First We have to blame the recruiters']"

Please  try to avoid it if possible in the next upcoming videos.', 'I think a lot of this has to do particularly with ad-revenues of FB which is going to take a major hit - thanks to Apple. Apple has brought in major privacy rules since their iOS 14.3 release that disallows sharing of data across apps. For app developers, it becomes mandatory for them now to highlight two aspects of data 1) Data used to track you 2) Data Linked to You. you can see this by visiting any app on apple store. This is has been made mandatory for all apps if they plan to update their app versions on the store.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, Google has not yet updated any of their apps since mid Dec. Wonder why!? :)\r\n\r\nAnyways, since now that this information be out in the domain, it becomes mandatory for FB and its products (WA, IG) to start looking at all sort of ways to monetize and maximize their efforts to make ads relevant for all users of their platforms. I believe this is why they have out rightly asked all users to accept the new privacy laws. While yes no one is going to be reading chat messages -  but here are some questions to think about - \r\nCan we have metadata or some sort of labeling done to names of groups on WhatsApp?  say you are part of investing, parenting, sports group can they profile a user with interests in ""Sports"", ""Finance"" and ""Parenting""\r\nCan these labels then be used for creating relevant ad lists?\r\nCould I enrich this data or use data points across platforms to target you digitally?\r\n\r\nThis is just my understanding and I am sure some experts here with relevant experience can add more insights to this?', 'Sir, Please make a video on IIT Madras Diploma program in Data Science.', 'How come C++ can be of any use for Data Scientists !!', 'Until and unless there is no law like GDPR in india, big tech will continue to profit from user data.\n\nWhatsApp forcing us to do one thing will lead to it forcing you to do other things. For how long? This is bullying of the user.\n\nSwitch to telegram or signal. Stay safe guys.', 'I work in the Ad-Tech domain as a Technical Product and Program Manager, specifically in DataScience, RPA, and e-Commerce. So, I do understand it\'s a gold mine for Analytics use cases, and there are many use cases that can be monetized easily. Most of the people don\'t have an idea what all go behind the scene when you visit some website and a simple irritating Ad is shown to you. You simply close it or maybe once in a while click on it. But a hell of information is shared from various sources ( if someone wants to read more: https://anantjigyasa.com/programmatic-advertising/ )\n\nAnyway, my point is - Will it help in Analytics use cases? yes, definitely but the world is much more than just the use cases. Companies have social responsibilities too. And just for clarification - ""It is only in the European Union that WhatsApp is legally bound to not share its data with Facebook."" Data protection laws in India has various loopholes.\n\nBut yes, definitely there are lots of misinformation as clarified in this article - https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-privacy-fake-claims-misinformation-busted-do-not-believe-these-false-myths-7140889/ \n\nBut given the FB reputation, this fear is not baseless!Especially when Whatsapp is forcing us to accept it or be kicked out. Brian Acton co-founder of WhatsApp (also founder of Signal) had a drift over the monetization of WhatsApp and displaying Ads over the WhatsApp in past and had to leave the company! So, whatever WhatsApp says as of now - we all know where it\'s heading!\n\nP.S: Recent clarification given from WhatsApp: ‚ÄúNeither\xa0WhatsApp\xa0nor\xa0Facebook\xa0can read your messages or hear your calls with your friends, family, and co-workers on WhatsApp. Whatever you share, it stays between you,‚Äù the platform said. In a thread, it added, ""Our privacy policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family.""', ""Sir I am graduated in 2019 in cs due to family issues am not worked for 1 year and now I wanted to learn data science ,where to start I don't know whether to do courses online r not please suggest me"", 'Sir plz one video for those student who pass out class 12 plz suggest what they to do in the field of data science', 'Imagine you have told your mom to order some  cough syrup for you on medlife because your sick, WhatsApp knows that and can send it to medlife which will increase the prices for cough syrup']"

But what I have a suggestion is, even though this interview had good questions, the way of conducting a professional interview should not be like this. An interview is not meant to stress the person who is being interviewed and confuse him. It is the responsibility of the interviewers to conduct an interview in the most peaceful calm way. We are humans and mistakes would be answered by everyone, anyone can be wrong, but the mistakes should not be pointed out in the middle of the interview, which inturn will drain the confidence of the interviewed guy. This kind of attitude is not expected from a professional interviewer. It becomes the responsibility of the interviewer too that if they point out a mistake they should correct the mistake by letting them know the concept or the right answer. Honestly, interviews are meant not to stress or pressurise the person or the people watching this mock interview. So it would be better to conduct such interviews in a modern way. Research the interview rules and post mock interview videos instead of pressurising the freshers. They do deserve a respect for their hardwork from the interviewers, even if they are not getting job atleast behave to them with a consideration as they are humans and not as a machine learning model trained with some stress parameters.', 'One thing is he was quick in answering those unpredicted questions, I would have been sitting like dumb and thinking a lot.', 'After seeing his interview iam not going for Data science', 'lol kisko bitha diya re .

Always try to answer to the point.\n3. If you do not know something, please tell the interviewer u dont know. It is ok to say u dont know instead of hitting around the bushes.\n4.  Do not be rude or show attitude in front of the interviewers. They are hiring you to run  a company. Definitely with this attitude you will never be able to clear any interviews in life unless you know someone in the company personally.\n\nPlease take this feedbacks. It will definitely help you all :) Happy Learning!!', 'Whats with this guy? If i was the interviewer i would have rejected him outright. The first thing a ds should think is whats the simplest way to get the result. If an ml model can do the trick, why go for dl? Paul has a very small bubble of thought where he just wants to implement dl without even thinking if the problem can be solved by ml or does it even require data science. Even after repeated attempts by Krish and Sudhanshu, he is not ready to listen. Damn. And Paul will forever be a worker, a slave to the company he works in. He doesnt want to innovate or go in the depth of an algo to understand the math behind it. Without using any brains he just wants to implement. And he will never fit in masters with this approach. Data science is built on maths and to ignore that is foolish. Hope he changes company and gets to face reality.', ""Few points to Paul.\n1. Your body language is very bad. You are most of the times swaying your chair. This shows you are not serious about the interview. \n2. You never listen to the complete question. This shows you don't have patience to listen and understand the question completely.\n3. Your answers are never to the point. You are only trying to beat around the bush with whatever little you know related to deep learning.\n4. Since you are already working with Sudhanshu and Krish, you do not have the seriousness of an interview. Looks like you are thinking it's a discussion over a cup of coffee.  \n5. Some of your answers look very innocent but when you try to argue or convince it looks like you are arrogant. For example. Maths is not important. You say coding is important end of day. How will you code if you do not know the maths behind it? If I ask you to add 2 numbers, how will you know that sum function will work if you don't know what is addition?\n6. With the above points adding to your communication skills, even if you do either a Masters or PhD nobody would hire you.\n7. I would personally have hired a graduate student and trained him if he had the right attitude and good communication skills.\n8. One more thing. You always kept saying OK at end of a sentence. It sounds like you are ordering or imposing on the interviewer.\n9. It is clearly evident that you have some pre-assumptions about a lot of things which is deep rooted in your mind. This is blocking your learning. You need to come out of those deep rooted assumptions and have a open mind to learn.\n10. Always note that Maths and Statistics are the basis for any ML/DL technology. Even long before computers were invented, many statisticians would perform linear regression with paper and pen. You should first learn ML thoroughly and then move to learn DL.\n\nHope you work on these things which will surely help you in your long term career. Please do not think its demotivation.

Basically if you're dealing with known established methods and mainly with scientific and tabular data, I feel R is easier to understand and more efficient from a code writing standpoint.  There are a ridiculous amount of stats packages and they can have very specific tasks and domains  which help you from having to build everything from the ground up. For sure the packages also are much better vetted than Python libraries.  Examples are typically well written and I feel the community is tighter.  On the other hand R will always lag behind Python on basically any new methods.  If you intend to work with any cutting edge subjects, be that reinforcement learning, BERT or things like FastAI, these will be in Python and may never get to R.  A big advantage as Krish noted is you can code in a full stack with Python.  If you want you can build your front end, your app all in Python.  Beyond Shiny, even if there is a GUI for R, it's really an afterthought with R, while Python has very active and progressing GUI frameworks.

But whatever you are telling about model deployment and see how it works on real-world problems, that productization process is everywhere.

If you compare NYC-DataScience program and any of our present DataScience post-graduate program in India, you would find only 50-60% has been covered in the curriculum compared to NYC. Nevertheless, my UpDegree teacher taught us my ""Big Data Engineer"" friend will do that(Deployment and API related) task. You just need to aware of the whole process. Even my own training institute didn\'t teach us the model deployment part. Their students are getting jobs.

If this doesn‚Äôt work use the following:\nA Nieve step can be filling it with means of the previous month‚Äôs value (maybe two months average)\nAnother way can be since it is a monthly data fill it with previous years same months average. \n(Ex: A missing value of temperature in Feb will be most likely to be average of previous    year‚Äôs Feb temperature)\nA little complicated Methods can be like building a linear regression model or KNN (or even Decision Tree)and impute the missing value.\n I would prefer b point.\n\nStep 1.1:\nFeature Engineering:\nHere creating new features can be based on the idea that tea production not only depends upon the current month‚Äôs variables but also on the previous month‚Äôs \nEx:\n[Max, Min, Mean] [Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity etc., ] in the last K months.\nHere K can be 2,3 or even 4 what variables to pick will be decided by the model\nComes in hand to handle any unpredictable even like Drought or Floods whose effect will last long. \n\nStep 2:\nBuilding a model:\nThings that we need to take care of: \n\nThis model is for production so any process or variables that we take used for model building should be available that‚Äôs why point ‚Äúa. In step 1‚Äù used only previous value but not the next months.\n\nMethod 1:\nBotton Line at the top (BLOT): Build a Time series model on overall data points (with respect to time component).\n\nAs expected a base naive model can be \nBuild a time series model with the dependent variable (by averaging based on month for all regions)\nHere which model to use ARIMA, LSTM or even Fourier Transform we will know based on the Efficiency, Predictability and Explainability.\n\nMethod 2:\nBLOT: Build a separate-separate Time series model on each location.\nThe production of tea is based upon the location which in turn based on climate, soil, water and other features‚Ä¶\nSo, building a separate time series based on location makes sense and not that hard for production\nIf anything goes wrong we have command and knowledge about what is happening and this is a major perk and helps the company to make decisions if anything goes wrong.\nAnd of course, the last line about which algorithm to use in Method 1 is applicable here.\n\nMethod 3:\nI doubt about this one but worth trying‚Ä¶\nBLOT: Solve it as a regression problem by trying to predict next month‚Äôs outcome.\nIf we think like building a supervised ML model straight away and try to predict the tea yield this won‚Äôt work on the production cause we would get the data simultaneously with respect to time. \nEx:\nWe would get the data both independent features and dependent feature at the end of the month so building a straight away model won‚Äôt do the job.\nSolution 1:\nHere one small trick can be like a month‚Äôs independent features and try to predict the yield of next month.\nPrepare the dataset in such a way \nEx:\nAn instance or a row in this dataset should be like independent features of the month Jan and the dependent feature should be the TEA PRODUCTION OF NEXT MOTNH ie., FEB\nIn this way, this can be used in production.\nNow this is a supervised problem so you can try building ensembles or stacking models\nAnd also here we can use Method 1 and Method 2 (building overall model and building model per location)\n\nMy suggestion is using a non-black box method so that we can justify the prediction.\n\nAdditional tip:\nTry to build a CART model with very very less depth(say 3) and see which features are being picked and build a model for each leaf.\nEx: say it picked location as a root node and next soil type as 2nd then build models (Method 1,2 or even 3) on each subset of data. \n\n\nThank from the bottom of my heart if anyone read it all. \nüòäüòç\nCh.

This becomes the week learner. This method does not follow Bootstrapping. The number of decision stumps it will make will depend on the number of features in the dataset. Suppose there are M features then, Adaboost will create M decision stumps. Following are the steps in Adaboost:\n\n1. A new sample weight matrix will be used to assign weight to each observation. for N number of records, the initial weight will be 1/N.\n2. To generate the first base learner/week learner (BS), M decision stumps are generated for the M number of features. Based on their information gain, best DS is selected.\n3. From this DS, total error (TE) is calculated based on the misclassification of samples by that DS. If total misclassification is T, TE=T/N where N is number of samples.\n4. Based on TE, its performace score(PS) is calculated, PS= 1/2*log(base e)((1-TE)/TE)\n5. Based on PS, new weights will be assigned to samples that are classified correctly and incorrectly.\n6. New weight for incorrectly classified sample: old weight * (e**(PS))\n7. New weight for correctly classified sample: old weight * (e**(-PS))\n8. This will increase the weight of incorrectly classified samples and decrease the weight of correctly classified samples. Which means that the next BS classifier will have to give more importance in learning the incorrectly classified samples.\n9.If the summation of the new weights are =! 1, we need to normalize the weight as : (new weight)/ summation of (all new weights)\n10. Based on new weights, some buckets/ranges/classes of normalized weights are formed. These weights will be used to form the new sample set for classification be the next weak learner.\n11. Based on some iterations for N number of times, and psudo randomly generated numbers between (0-1) the new samples are selected from the old sample list based on where it falls in the buckets of normalized weights.\n12.The process between step (2-11) is repeated till the error reduces to the minimum.\n13.During the testing of data, each data will be classified using the multiple BS, and a majority voting will be used to generate the final output.\n\n\n\n\nps: Feel free to correct me if I made any mistake..', 'How to decide, how much iteration we can perform to select randomly data points for second decision tree.
