This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]",codebasics

Crypto has been a hot topic of discussion lately even for those outside the core crypto community, but unfortunately, it\'s not for the best of reasons.

Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market.

So web and app development team of skillsbasics complete course is to make an end to end app on this use case. Machine learning course of skillsbasics solve the same use case though their algorithms to make predictions on the same. So on whole what i mean is let us take an idea as a use case and implies various technologies on the same and give the real world use case as a package to the learner of the course. From learner's perspective, more than learning a technology, it will be like reading a story book, which will also walk him through the technologies as well encouraging him to think about helping the people of the world by addressing real world common problems of them.\n\nAnd I strongly possess learning technologies will do nothing unless we apply it to solve the problem of common people through it.

The time to provide feedback has elapsed long back. I have a  few suggestions in case you happen to read my comments . I had published the comments yesterday. I don't see it in the comments section. Hence posting again.\n\n1. We can have trend reports for sales in countries and zones. This will help the company if they want to expand business in certain zones and countries.\n\n2. Analysis can be done to find out the reason for low sales in the bottom 5 (any number) customers/countries/zones. This insight can lead to actions to boost sales.\n\n3. We can have a table to capture the service requests logged by customers along with priority and other related details and add relevant reports to the dashboard. \n\n4. Scheduled delivery date can be added for each order and actual delivery date to know if there's a delay in the order.\n\n5. Another table can be added to capture the order details.  A report for the top 5 orders can be added to the dashboard.\n\n6. Customers can be categorized into Gold, Silver, and Copper and relevant reports can be added for each category of customers.\n\n7. Predictive analysis can be done to predict the sales for top 5(or any) customers/zones/countries and the sales team can get ready to ship the items accordingly. These reports can be published to the Sales team. \n\n8. Table to capture rating for products similar to how Amazon captures ratings and reviews. This will help Atliq Hardware business owners to decide whether the same items should be continued for procurement. In case they are manufactured by Atliq, they can decide if there should be any enhancement to the features to satisfy the customers.\n\n9. One report for returned items with the reason for the return can be added too. This will give insights if the low sales are related to returned items for a customer.\n\n10. Different BINs can be added for trend reports and top reports on the dashboard. However, it will be good, if the reports loaded can be tied to the role of the user logged in. For example,  trend reports and top customer/country/zone reports can be shown for the executives and sales prediction reports can be loaded for the sales team.\n\n11. You could add the date and time at the top of the dashboard to indicate when the page is getting refreshed.\n\n12. If possible, you could let the user add a note for any report and the note should be sent to the respective team to take action once submitted."", 'One more suggestion.

Does it disregard the timezone of the datetime object during the slicing operation (therefore, it assumes that the datetime objects have the same timezone as the pandas index); or does it detect the timezone from the datetime objects, converts them into the same timezone of the pandas index, and, only then, apply the slicing operation?\n\nSincerely,', 'Great explanation!

Eastern's  program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive.

Even the comments sections in your videos are insightful."", 'one of the best data science channels out there.. kia kaha tonu..keep going', 'Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a ""sanitized"" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing ""notebooks"" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data?\n\n\nPerhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is  a model necessary? \n\n\nThe curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users.

Some of my comments:\n1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a ""good code"" by engineers. But obviously if you can\'t efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren\'t ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting ""classic"" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both.\n2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be ""consumed"" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don\'t have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it\'s rather inefficient.\n3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it!\n4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it\'s like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don\'t change as often.\n5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time.\n\n\nMy resolutions:\n1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels.  NOT being just a ""cog"" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work.\n2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels.\n3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren\'t data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo)\n4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML\n5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert\n6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don\'t have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what\'s going on in our field)\n7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I\'ve been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I\'ll be able to make it useful soon!\n\n\nThank you for an interesting and relatable video!', 'My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall.

With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop.  Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined.  Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up.  When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game.  Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game.  If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game.\n\n\nThe NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix."", '#GoodTalk']",Ken Jee

Recommendation System:\nWhen a person log in, get all the information regarding the person like what product he/she likes, what does the person prefer, get the browsing history of that person. Now based on the product he/she buys, we can set item-based filtering recommendation or collaborative -based filtering. Now, to tackle the cold start problem, whenever a new person comes in for the first time, show what products does he/she likes, show the tags. Once we have the data we get specific based on tag and at least show some recommendation.\n\n2. Facial Recognition:\nFirst we have to determine what are all the range pf products available i.e.what products are available for what part of the face. We have to check if the person is male or female. Train a model or use a pretrained model which will get the facial characteristics of the face, like if it detects a beard then recommend beard oil or a trimmer. For the female recommend cream, lotion based on the marks, spots on the face. This can be done with uploaded photos or real time camera using openCV. Similarly, like the previous to tackle cold start problem, show what products he/she is interested in, show the tags, get the history etc.\n\n3. Logistic Procurement:\nThe main objective here I believe is to show whether or not we need more material or less material for the product. This is a kind of optimization problem where we are minimizing the raw materials needed. I have 2 approach for this-\n  a. First one is model based. First, we have to see what different types of juice are there to make. Based on that we have to see the material we need to build the product. We have get all the characteristics/features of the juice which contributes in using raw materials more or less. We can build a model based on those and either predict whether it will use more or less material (binary classification task) or predict what is amount of material the product is going to use (linear regression task). \n  b. The second way is based on heuristic approach. If the product use different material to to be build i.e. let say some amount of each \'n\' material to make a product. Now to minimize the amount needed for each material we can use genetic algorithm to get that or other optimization algorithm to do that.Though this not so efficient, if we have lets say 100 products each using \'n\' materials type as we have to do for all.\n\n4. Car Problem:\nThis use case is in kinda broad spectrum. I am no knowledge in car making but still answering it.\n  a. Damage Detection: A car has many parts inside and outside the body. We can separate damage detection in terms of ""analog i.e. mechanical parts and digital i.e. in software parts"".\n      i. For the damage detection in mechanical parts like brakes, engine, tires etc. we can build a model which can detect damage and do segmentation of that part. For this to happen we need to install camera inside the engine hood and underneath the car. A damage can be detected not only by images but with sensors too. The car software can analyze the data to get a warning like this parts seems fishy, kindly check it out.\n     ii. For the damage in the software parts, show warning about the software parts.\nTo make it work both side needs to work together.\n\n  b. AC control: First off sense the outside temperature via sensor, sense the inside of the car also, get the temperature from both sides, then don\'t turn on the AC immediately just show a prompt on the screen whether or not turn on the AC. Let\'s keep the action on the user part. Imagine if someone has cold inside the car and suddenly it turn on the AC, good luck.

ML try to do the same i.e. estimate a formula, let say I want to calculate the purchasing power (P) so I train a model with different variables like income,age, family income and m model fetches a formula  P = wo+ b1*income+b2*age + b3* family income..... So this formula is not absolute or universal as its derived by a specific ML algo for specific data but let say by miracle we derive a formula that exactly calculates the purchasing power with 100 percent accuracy so for that model bias is 0 as the model accurately captures the relationship..... Variance ---- Talking about variance, in short way the difference in fits between data set is called variance , imagine we used that same miracle formula in test data and data fits 100 percent as in we get 100 percent accuracy(for different test set) then we can say that the variance is 0 which means the ML formula is perfect or let say when use the same miracle formula in test set we get 50% accuracy which means the bias was low but variance is high as formula didnt work well with unseen (test) data...

Therefore there would be some differences between them. the sample mean will be close to the population mean. \n\nNow coming to sample variance and population variance, the difference will be huge between the sum of the squares of the difference between data and sample mean and the sum of squares of (data - population mean). This is due to the small difference between the sample mean and population mean. When it is squared the difference is more. To compensate for the difference we use n-1 in the denominator to increase the value such that the sample variance is closer to the population variance.

Many colleges wants to show only successful alumni as if it was their training that did the magic...:)', 'Kris sir Asp.net development mei career kaisa hai long term', 'Totally agree with Krish. When people tell me these things my simple question to them is - ""Do you want to keep crying over what you didn\'t or don\'t have OR you want to make effort to make your future better?"" It\'s that simple! Whatever problem was there genuine or your excuse but it had already happened. Now, what options you have? We don\'t have a time machine yet - so can\'t go back and change things. So, the only feasible option is to do things now that will make your future better otherwise again 2 -5 years down the lane you will be crying if I had done this at that time things would have been different. This is applicable to any situation.\nYes, being in tier-1 college does help. I prefer the marathon analogy in this respect. Life is not a 100 meters race but a marathon. Being from a tier-1 college can give you, maybe, 50 meters ahead start. IF you are looking for short-term accomplishments such as the first job CTC then in most cases yes the one from tier-1 has an advantage (though not always - there are students who have done great wonders even without a proper college education).  But in long term, you have ample opportunities to overtake him/her. Though I am not a big fan of such competition - just giving an example as most people are used to compare themselves with the others. Instead of this, it will be better if we have our own goal defined be it money wise or profile wise (just talking with respect to jobs, not life in general). And there is no shame in having a money-oriented goals. I see many students/people giving philosophical answers because in Indian society we have been trained this way to be money-oriented is bad! ( in the majority of the middle class - not directly but indirectly). Anyway coming back to the original topic - being from a tier-3 college may put you 50 meters behind - so you need to put an extra effort and work hard to cover this gap. I have seen lots of students and have lots of friends from tier-1,2,3 colleges and after 8 years of jobs, now it hardly matters who came from IIT Bombay or Kharagpur or who came from LPU or VTU colleges. In fact, I have seen the other way around. One of my friend didn\'t get in very good college so he put an extra effort in off-campus and gave more than 15 interviews in a row. He didn\'t confine himself to the on-campus opportunities and this I am talking about 2011-12, now things have become much better. Yes, he started at lower ctc but his determination and hard work paid off - he learned whatever he worked on in-depth (believe me most of us in the IT industry just completes our works NOT really go in-depth of the things and understand it in and out). He switched to another company and the next switch was a big e-commerce company and his ctc was well above 20 in the first 3 years. I have various similar examples recently someone switched from ctc of 8 to 30+ in Walmart (he also doesn\'t come from tier-1 college). Anyway, the bottom line is you have to put in extra effort and have patience. \n\nSpend time working towards your goal rather than crying over what you don\'t have or didn\'t have. And if you really feel you are at disadvantage then pickup google and search or maybe just look around yourself. You will find so many people who are in much much much worse condition than yourself but still, they are not making those things stop them. I have so many examples but won\'t bore with those stories, maybe in some blog I can put all these to motivate people because people like actual anecdotes. \n\nAnd many people ask me or here also are asking - not from tech background what to do? Whoever reached out to me, I have answered them in detail as per their profile or given some references who have made similar transitions. Wil briefly mention it here else this comment will become an article! :P \nNon tech background comes in two categories:\n1> Engineering but not CS/IT\n2> Non-engineers BA,Commerce etc.\n\nSee, above is degree wise category. But what I prefer is a knowledge-wise categorization (for preparation):\n1>You know about data science and software engineering. For example one of my cousins - was in minings but he did a side project in Java. So, even though he was not from tech background he had a fair understanding of tech and had a knack for programming.\n2> You have no clue about data science but have done some small crash course in some programming language or you know some basics about coding. Mech or Civil guy who just studies \'C\' in the first sem but never opened it again. Or some commerce student (one of my friend she did a course in NIIT in Java - yes when I was in college Java was a kind of defacto language to learn) but then didn\'t practice much and became an accountant.\n3> You have no clue about the software industry, tech, programming language, etc. \n\nWhy I categorize people ethis way because it help me to suggest a feasible plan for them. I was recently talking to a girl from non-tech background falling in third category. Now, it will be unrealistic if I suggest to her that in 6 months she can be ready for a data science interview. \nOne thing I forgot - my first question to all these people especially someone who has no clue about software, DS etc.  is ""WHY?"". THE WHY is very important - why you want to transition to DS. This why tells you how much effort and passion that person has for making the shift. Many of the people reply to me \'because it\'s a hot job nowadays and getting paid handsomely\' - it is okay if you want to make a switch for money but do you really like whatever you know about DS and if you don\'t about DS then why do you want to make switch? Because like any other field - it requires dedication to excel and if you don\'t excel then you won\'t be getting that high pay for which you switched in the first place - you will get a job and will be doing good (even if you don\'t excel excel in it). If you have a strong \'why\' then it becomes easy to stick to the plan.\n\nPost these things - decide a timeline. Let\'s say 1 year. then plan to finish the syllabus by 9 months and keep the last 3 months for revising and interview prep. I have seen many people good with tech but not prepared for an interview  - they get nervous or  not able to explain in clear and concise manner or having a language barrier. And then many don\'t come prepared for the company - when you go for an interview even if it\'s just a developer role - read about that company. When asked the question do you know this company then don\'t just say not really - I have got that answer many times. Then it gives an impression you didn\'t even put an effort into knowing about the company where you are going to work then how much effort you will put in the job! So spend last 3 months searching , applying and practicing. \nPrior to that breakdown the whole syllabus into smaller milestones. Le\'s say Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning etc. Then further break it down. And keep something which you can achieve in 2 weeks. LEt\'s say you plan 2 weeks for regression - then keep 30-40% in theory and rest of the time spend in implementing what you learnt. MAke sure to add in GitHub and share on social media - LinkedIn etc. And there are various blog sites - you can write down what you learned. Benefit of this? One of my professor told me once - if you want to know if you have understood something try teaching that to someone who doesn\'t know it or to a kid and if you are able to explain it to them then that means you have really understood it. So if you write a blog - while writing only you will know your weak points and post that once published many people will read it and they can point out the mistakes too. Don\'t be afraid of making mistakes - one who makes mistakes can only correct it. One who never wrote it or tried it can never correct it. \nWhy have 2 weeks goal because that way you can track your progress quickly - if you are off the track within 2 weeks you will know and can work to fix it. If you keep big milestones such as in 3 months I will finish \'X\' syllabus then only after 3 months you will have time to fix it and also, you will get a little laid back thinking you have 3 months to complete. \n\nWhile doing all this make sure to network. Reach out to people from DS field and talk to them, and also connect with people who are making a transition similar to you. Networking helps you a lot - it\'s known and shared at many places - about 2/3 of jobs comes via referrals,connections etc. they are not put out in Naukri kind of job portal (straight away). And spend some time in preparing the syllabus for your plan don\'t just put the stuffs which are fancy but not much used in all the DS jobs for example GANs - very good and I love them but majority of DS jobs at least when you are starting doesn\'t require knowledge of GAN. So when you have limited time focus on the important topics not just fancy ones!\n\nIf you follow your plan then you can for sure achieve your goal. Just make a feasible plan and stick to it.\n\nHappy to connect over LinkedIn to help further - https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitsrivastava/', '""Whatever you are going through in life, just remember one thing...\n\n\nIt\'s all your fault""', 'Do more such videos sir', 'okay krish sir.....i feel ashamed and a sense of self realisation..............I will work more harder from now onwards', 'First We have to blame the recruiters']",Krish Naik

Apple has brought in major privacy rules since their iOS 14.3 release that disallows sharing of data across apps. For app developers, it becomes mandatory for them now to highlight two aspects of data 1) Data used to track you 2) Data Linked to You. you can see this by visiting any app on apple store. This is has been made mandatory for all apps if they plan to update their app versions on the store.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, Google has not yet updated any of their apps since mid Dec. Wonder why!? :)\r\n\r\nAnyways, since now that this information be out in the domain, it becomes mandatory for FB and its products (WA, IG) to start looking at all sort of ways to monetize and maximize their efforts to make ads relevant for all users of their platforms. I believe this is why they have out rightly asked all users to accept the new privacy laws. While yes no one is going to be reading chat messages -  but here are some questions to think about - \r\nCan we have metadata or some sort of labeling done to names of groups on WhatsApp?  say you are part of investing, parenting, sports group can they profile a user with interests in ""Sports"", ""Finance"" and ""Parenting""\r\nCan these labels then be used for creating relevant ad lists?\r\nCould I enrich this data or use data points across platforms to target you digitally?\r\n\r\nThis is just my understanding and I am sure some experts here with relevant experience can add more insights to this?', 'Sir, Please make a video on IIT Madras Diploma program in Data Science.', 'How come C++ can be of any use for Data Scientists !!', 'Until and unless there is no law like GDPR in india, big tech will continue to profit from user data.\n\nWhatsApp forcing us to do one thing will lead to it forcing you to do other things.

But a hell of information is shared from various sources ( if someone wants to read more: https://anantjigyasa.com/programmatic-advertising/ )\n\nAnyway, my point is - Will it help in Analytics use cases? yes, definitely but the world is much more than just the use cases.

Data protection laws in India has various loopholes.\n\nBut yes, definitely there are lots of misinformation as clarified in this article - https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/whatsapp-privacy-fake-claims-misinformation-busted-do-not-believe-these-false-myths-7140889/ \n\nBut given the FB reputation, this fear is not baseless!Especially when Whatsapp is forcing us to accept it or be kicked out.

An interview is not meant to stress the person who is being interviewed and confuse him. It is the responsibility of the interviewers to conduct an interview in the most peaceful calm way. We are humans and mistakes would be answered by everyone, anyone can be wrong, but the mistakes should not be pointed out in the middle of the interview, which inturn will drain the confidence of the interviewed guy. This kind of attitude is not expected from a professional interviewer. It becomes the responsibility of the interviewer too that if they point out a mistake they should correct the mistake by letting them know the concept or the right answer. Honestly, interviews are meant not to stress or pressurise the person or the people watching this mock interview. So it would be better to conduct such interviews in a modern way. Research the interview rules and post mock interview videos instead of pressurising the freshers.

Do not be rude or show attitude in front of the interviewers. They are hiring you to run  a company.

It will definitely help you all :) Happy Learning!!', 'Whats with this guy? If i was the interviewer i would have rejected him outright. The first thing a ds should think is whats the simplest way to get the result. If an ml model can do the trick, why go for dl? Paul has a very small bubble of thought where he just wants to implement dl without even thinking if the problem can be solved by ml or does it even require data science. Even after repeated attempts by Krish and Sudhanshu, he is not ready to listen. Damn. And Paul will forever be a worker, a slave to the company he works in. He doesnt want to innovate or go in the depth of an algo to understand the math behind it. Without using any brains he just wants to implement. And he will never fit in masters with this approach. Data science is built on maths and to ignore that is foolish. Hope he changes company and gets to face reality.', ""Few points to Paul.\n1. Your body language is very bad.

Since you are already working with Sudhanshu and Krish, you do not have the seriousness of an interview. Looks like you are thinking it's a discussion over a cup of coffee.  \n5. Some of your answers look very innocent but when you try to argue or convince it looks like you are arrogant. For example. Maths is not important. You say coding is important end of day. How will you code if you do not know the maths behind it? If I ask you to add 2 numbers, how will you know that sum function will work if you don't know what is addition?\n6. With the above points adding to your communication skills, even if you do either a Masters or PhD nobody would hire you.\n7. I would personally have hired a graduate student and trained him if he had the right attitude and good communication skills.\n8. One more thing. You always kept saying OK at end of a sentence. It sounds like you are ordering or imposing on the interviewer.\n9. It is clearly evident that you have some pre-assumptions about a lot of things which is deep rooted in your mind. This is blocking your learning. You need to come out of those deep rooted assumptions and have a open mind to learn.\n10. Always note that Maths and Statistics are the basis for any ML/DL technology. Even long before computers were invented, many statisticians would perform linear regression with paper and pen. You should first learn ML thoroughly and then move to learn DL.\n\nHope you work on these things which will surely help you in your long term career. Please do not think its demotivation.

Basically if you're dealing with known established methods and mainly with scientific and tabular data, I feel R is easier to understand and more efficient from a code writing standpoint.  There are a ridiculous amount of stats packages and they can have very specific tasks and domains  which help you from having to build everything from the ground up. For sure the packages also are much better vetted than Python libraries.  Examples are typically well written and I feel the community is tighter.  On the other hand R will always lag behind Python on basically any new methods.  If you intend to work with any cutting edge subjects, be that reinforcement learning, BERT or things like FastAI, these will be in Python and may never get to R.  A big advantage as Krish noted is you can code in a full stack with Python.  If you want you can build your front end, your app all in Python.  Beyond Shiny, even if there is a GUI for R, it's really an afterthought with R, while Python has very active and progressing GUI frameworks.

In step 1‚Äù used only previous value but not the next months.\n\nMethod 1:\nBotton Line at the top (BLOT): Build a Time series model on overall data points (with respect to time component).\n\nAs expected a base naive model can be \nBuild a time series model with the dependent variable (by averaging based on month for all regions)\nHere which model to use ARIMA, LSTM or even Fourier Transform we will know based on the Efficiency, Predictability and Explainability.\n\nMethod 2:\nBLOT: Build a separate-separate Time series model on each location.\nThe production of tea is based upon the location which in turn based on climate, soil, water and other features‚Ä¶\nSo, building a separate time series based on location makes sense and not that hard for production\nIf anything goes wrong we have command and knowledge about what is happening and this is a major perk and helps the company to make decisions if anything goes wrong.\nAnd of course, the last line about which algorithm to use in Method 1 is applicable here.\n\nMethod 3:\nI doubt about this one but worth trying‚Ä¶\nBLOT: Solve it as a regression problem by trying to predict next month‚Äôs outcome.\nIf we think like building a supervised ML model straight away and try to predict the tea yield this won‚Äôt work on the production cause we would get the data simultaneously with respect to time. \nEx:\nWe would get the data both independent features and dependent feature at the end of the month so building a straight away model won‚Äôt do the job.\nSolution 1:\nHere one small trick can be like a month‚Äôs independent features and try to predict the yield of next month.\nPrepare the dataset in such a way \nEx:\nAn instance or a row in this dataset should be like independent features of the month Jan and the dependent feature should be the TEA PRODUCTION OF NEXT MOTNH ie., FEB\nIn this way, this can be used in production.\nNow this is a supervised problem so you can try building ensembles or stacking models\nAnd also here we can use Method 1 and Method 2 (building overall model and building model per location)\n\nMy suggestion is using a non-black box method so that we can justify the prediction.\n\nAdditional tip:\nTry to build a CART model with very very less depth(say 3) and see which features are being picked and build a model for each leaf.\nEx: say it picked location as a root node and next soil type as 2nd then build models (Method 1,2 or even 3) on each subset of data. \n\n\nThank from the bottom of my heart if anyone read it all. \nüòäüòç\nCh.

This becomes the week learner. This method does not follow Bootstrapping. The number of decision stumps it will make will depend on the number of features in the dataset. Suppose there are M features then, Adaboost will create M decision stumps. Following are the steps in Adaboost:\n\n1. A new sample weight matrix will be used to assign weight to each observation. for N number of records, the initial weight will be 1/N.\n2. To generate the first base learner/week learner (BS), M decision stumps are generated for the M number of features. Based on their information gain, best DS is selected.\n3. From this DS, total error (TE) is calculated based on the misclassification of samples by that DS. If total misclassification is T, TE=T/N where N is number of samples.\n4. Based on TE, its performace score(PS) is calculated, PS= 1/2*log(base e)((1-TE)/TE)\n5. Based on PS, new weights will be assigned to samples that are classified correctly and incorrectly.\n6. New weight for incorrectly classified sample: old weight * (e**(PS))\n7. New weight for correctly classified sample: old weight * (e**(-PS))\n8. This will increase the weight of incorrectly classified samples and decrease the weight of correctly classified samples.

Right now I'm using ROS with a raspi mounted on mine for teleoperation and other cool features but I'd like to train it to make sense of it's surroundings and eventually just act on it's own (for now walking and flipping would be a start). \n\nI see a couple of comments about calculating energy usage and how you could do it on Bittle. One thing that comes to mind is to simulate the current draw from the battery to each of the motors-basically simulate the battery on the robot as well. So for example, if motor 8 moves by 0.2, the battery discharges 0.5%. These are made up numbers as I didn't look into the exact draw of the servo motors.\n\nThe second change you could make which would benefit the simulated battery is to have a delayed reward, so instead of getting a reward after each action, you get a reward after either making it a certain distance or fully depleting the battery, and this would reset the simulation. This would encourage Bittle to not only move in a certain direction, but to also conserve energy with movements. This also alleviates your worry of over constraining the robot, and since you have the resources for training it should work just as well with the Proximal Policy."", ""Hi there, I'm here after 2 months after I collected a lot of experience with RL.

1gQR24B3ISE,"[""Just wanted to say It is PERFECT when you don't cut the parts which you bump into an error, because we can see the way you think through it. It helps a loootttt..."", 'Hi sentdex, I know I am three years late, but I want to add that there actually is a quick way of computing the output size of the convolutional layers, but it depends on multiple factors. Here, it boils down to:\n128 * [50 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2 - 4 / 2]^2 = 128 * 2 * 2,\nwhere 128 is the number of output channels, 50 is the input size, / denotes floor division and the operations in the brackets are written in order from left to right for readability.\nI will now try to explain, how I came up with this formula:\nThe first thing we need to regard is the input size. Here, we have a 50x50 image. This is our starting point, the size of the resulting feature maps will (usually) never exceed the input size.\nThe next important parameter is the kernel size of the convolutional layers. For this tutorial, you used a 5 by 5 kernel. (To understand how it will affect the input layer, you must regard other parameters like kernel stride etc., but since you used the default values, I won\'t explain them here) The kernel will convolute a 5x5 grid into a new value, then move to the next position, until the whole input image is processed into a so-called ""feature map"". So, how big is this feature map? Because the kernel operates on a 5x5 grid, it will start with its center aligned on pixel index index (2, 2) (index ranging from 0 to 49) and end on pixel index (47, 47). Therefore, there is a 2 pixel margin on each side, which is ""lost"" in the feature map. The resulting feature map is 2 pixels smaller than the input image on each side, resulting in a size of 46*46. I don\'t know if my explanation is good enough, for anyone wondering, try to find some visualizations of convolutional neural networks, it really helps to understand how they operate.\nThe next step is maxpooling. Here, we use a 2x2 kernel. Effectively, this means that the size of our feature maps will be halved, leaving us with a 23*23 feature map. However, this was only the first convolutional layer!\nSo, let\'s repeat this calculation twice:\nSecond Layer: (23, 23) - (4, 4) = (19, 19), (19, 19) / 2= (9, 9)\nThird Layer: (9, 9) - (4, 4) = (5, 5), (5, 5) / 2 = (2, 2)\nFinally, we have to multiply the size of the feature map with the number of output channels of the final convolutional layer, which is 128.', 'Here is how they got to a flattened size of 4x4x50:\nInput image size is 28x28x1 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 20 features) -> 24x24x20 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 12x12x20 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 50 features) -> 8x8x50 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 4x4x50.\n\nHere is how you got to 2x2x128:\nInput image size is 50x50x1 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 32 features) -> 46x46x32 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 23x23x32 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 64 features) -> 19x19x64 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 9x9x64 -> conv2d (5x5 kernel, 128 features) -> 5x5x128 -> max pooling (2x2) -> 2x2x128.\n\nYou get those numbers when doing calculations on paper first :)\n\n* this is considering you use a padding of 0 (no padding) and a stride of 1.', 'PyTorch (2022) now offers a flatten function from what I recall.', 'How to calculate input size of first fully-connected layer. To do it you have to understand what happening with matrix size during each operation. Layer have have kernel 5x5 and padding = 0. That means that layer will cut 2 pixels from each side reducing matrix size by 4 in each dimension. Also max pool 2x2 will reduce matrix size in half. In our case we have:\nInput image is 50x50\nConv2d(1, 32, (5, 5))  |  50x50x1 -> 46x46x32\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  46x46x32 -> 23x23x32\nConv2d(32, 64, (5, 5))  |  23x23x32 -> 19x19x64\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  19x19x64 -> 9x9x64\nConv2d(64, 128, (5, 5))  |  9x9x64 -> 5x5x128\nmax_pool2d(x, (2, 2))  |  5x5x128 -> 2x2x128\nNow we know size of the matrix (2x2) and we defined the number of channels (128) before, so we can define input size of fc1.\n2x2x128 = 512', 'bro it shows error like ""Found dtype Double but expected Float"" what should I do now?', 'What would the 4th dimension usally be?

So its a two step problem: hit the wall once and then search for food. But the first step is happening quickly because of the drift.  This will help learning. The q-values will be significantly higher for states when food and player are same color squares so I imagine it gets there quickly and because of the value differences.\nYou could also think of the state space as being 50 states where player and food are on same colour and 50 states where player and food on different colors.  In other words, there is one state space where there is a food item and another state space where there isn't any food.  The drift term ensures frequent transitions between these two state spaces so I imagine it will learn quite quickly the food state is more valuable than the non-food state and you'll have a positive slope for q-values towards the state with the food item.\n  \nI""]",sentdex

Thanks for sharing your knowledge about Python, ML, AI, etc.  At ~15:50 in this video, you start filtering your unemployment DF for February 2015.  It appears that, rather than being arbitrary, you inadvertently thought that Feb-2015 is the latest month and year of unemployment rate data.  If so, you're mistaken.  If you further explore the unemployment data, you'll find that unemployment rates are available all the way through December 2016.  Given the presidential election politics in the US (and in any country for that matter), the unemployment rates and resulting public sentiment become most relevant/influential just before such important elections.  Therefore, a better example would have explored the correlation/covariance between the county-wise unemployment rates and the voting data as of October/November 2016.  Just to be sure, I do understand that your intent was just to show how one could find some correlation between seemingly disparate data.  Of course, the actual conclusions/interpretations from such analysis are subject to personal opinions.  Admittedly, in the grand scheme of things, it's the data frames - not the specific time frames - that matter.  Cheers!""]",sentdex

I.e. 55-56% of the time the price is increasing. So for the sake of evaluating an investment model, you need to first establish the percent of days where the price is increasing, and set that as your base. Any improvement above that is better than just buying and ""hodling"". OR you can prune your data by training it on an equal amount of buy/sell periods. With an LSTM, though, this would be a bit more tricky. This can work for a Transformer or Conv-based model.']",sentdex

I presumed you would use MacOS over Windows for Python development.', 'You could incorporate AI for specific choices and meanwhile you write logic for other choices and then slowly let loose on the AI by letting it make other choices too. A great way of doing that is having a logic for every choice but having a percentage say X. Then you let AI make the choice X percent of the time and if the choice is hard to make, you keep X very low. But later, you start increasing X as your AI grows smart enough to compensate for some losses in favor of training and eventually it will be the AI making all the choices. This way, a lot of what your AI learns might depend on your own logic that you begin with but if you train for long enough after increasing X for all choices to 100, AI will definitely develop a  unique style. \n\nGood work!

Also i dont know if the ai is able to use chat but if it can scout should see building and type on chat if there is an existing one or not (you can do that for location on gas atleast). The reason for this for you bot to improve later on by if you see either the enemy collecting crystals only or is it already out on gas. The reason behind it if you ever want to try your bot out against players or against stronger bots(would be rly fun later on) should predict a tactic which should be built upon the enemy is out on gas or not (early gas means sooner ""techning"" means more advenced units and if you see that either you can mass zealot and rush them before they finish or just expand as well to tech too) And in starcraft everything is about time frame so if you see the enemy on gas before xy time with scout you could built in a true/false statment then you dont need to build cybernetic core or other base make gateway and overwhelm them with zealots. That could have been an option to choose. I think the ai should have choose between strategies then you indentify those strategies instead of choosing between units.

For example the bot can take care of micro while the player can do the micro. This is what I am working on right now and it works quite well (when simulation is in real time). However I am thinking of several ways in which the user can interact with the assistant bot. Maybe you can do some tutorials...

PA-TVHARu4w,"['how to check whether a message is received or not in mpi4py.', ""Update for anyone still using these tutorials... \n\nWhen trying to use the send command across more than 1 worker node (i.e. -np 3) I received an error: Connection Refused. This happened even though the devices could communicate through SSH. I could see this if I removed the file from a node, I would get an error saying it didn't exist. I also tested using each node individually as rank 1 and they worked on their own.\n\nTo fix this problem I had to pass the argument -disable-hostname-propagation to mpirun. This bug is from hydra passing the hostnames to MPICH2 by default if you put the hostnames in your machinefile.\n\nAnother fix is to use IP addresses instead of hostnames in your machinefile.

Message type, size, and tag are all optional or unnecessary, that's really nice. "", ""The reason the order doesn't matter is because you're using blocking send and recv, so the receiving rank will block in the receive until it gets the data that it's expecting.\xa0 What you've essentially done by adding the sleep is introduce an artificial load imbalance between the two processes, but since both are using blocking send/recv, neither will progress until its part has completed. (For most MPI implementations, the send may actually start progressing again before the data has actually been sent over the wire. The data doesn't have to arrived, but it must be safe to overwrite the send buffer once the send routine returns) Now, if you replaced your receive with a non-blocking receive, your print could (and likely would) happen before the data has been received. I think the reason you were able to run multiple ranks\xa0 on that node without things getting hung up due to python's global lock is because you're likely running 2 python interpreters in two separate processes (as opposed to threading within a single interpreter). Keep up the good work, it looks like you're learning a lot as you go, which is awesome.""]",sentdex
