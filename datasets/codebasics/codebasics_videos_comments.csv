This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. \n\nDo any of you need prayer?\n\n\n\nY""]"

Crypto has been a hot topic of discussion lately even for those outside the core crypto community, but unfortunately, it\'s not for the best of reasons.

Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Making a decent benefit off crypto is simple if and just in the event that you can track down the correct section point and leave point in your day exchanging.

So web and app development team of skillsbasics complete course is to make an end to end app on this use case. Machine learning course of skillsbasics solve the same use case though their algorithms to make predictions on the same. So on whole what i mean is let us take an idea as a use case and implies various technologies on the same and give the real world use case as a package to the learner of the course. From learner's perspective, more than learning a technology, it will be like reading a story book, which will also walk him through the technologies as well encouraging him to think about helping the people of the world by addressing real world common problems of them.\n\nAnd I strongly possess learning technologies will do nothing unless we apply it to solve the problem of common people through it.

The time to provide feedback has elapsed long back. I have a  few suggestions in case you happen to read my comments . I had published the comments yesterday. I don't see it in the comments section. Hence posting again.\n\n1. We can have trend reports for sales in countries and zones. This will help the company if they want to expand business in certain zones and countries.\n\n2. Analysis can be done to find out the reason for low sales in the bottom 5 (any number) customers/countries/zones. This insight can lead to actions to boost sales.\n\n3. We can have a table to capture the service requests logged by customers along with priority and other related details and add relevant reports to the dashboard. \n\n4. Scheduled delivery date can be added for each order and actual delivery date to know if there's a delay in the order.\n\n5. Another table can be added to capture the order details.  A report for the top 5 orders can be added to the dashboard.\n\n6. Customers can be categorized into Gold, Silver, and Copper and relevant reports can be added for each category of customers.\n\n7. Predictive analysis can be done to predict the sales for top 5(or any) customers/zones/countries and the sales team can get ready to ship the items accordingly. These reports can be published to the Sales team. \n\n8. Table to capture rating for products similar to how Amazon captures ratings and reviews. This will help Atliq Hardware business owners to decide whether the same items should be continued for procurement. In case they are manufactured by Atliq, they can decide if there should be any enhancement to the features to satisfy the customers.\n\n9. One report for returned items with the reason for the return can be added too. This will give insights if the low sales are related to returned items for a customer.\n\n10. Different BINs can be added for trend reports and top reports on the dashboard. However, it will be good, if the reports loaded can be tied to the role of the user logged in. For example,  trend reports and top customer/country/zone reports can be shown for the executives and sales prediction reports can be loaded for the sales team.\n\n11. You could add the date and time at the top of the dashboard to indicate when the page is getting refreshed.\n\n12. If possible, you could let the user add a note for any report and the note should be sent to the respective team to take action once submitted."", 'One more suggestion.
