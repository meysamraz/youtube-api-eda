HLU4oDOinzo,codebasics,What is Metaverse? Metaverse Career Opportunities,"Explain Metaverse as if I am 5 years old. In this video, I will provide a very simple explanation of Metaverse and also discuss career opportunities associated with it.

Metaverse is the future of the internet, the future of everything!” Many tech CEOs have quoted this in one or the other way. But what exactly is Metaverse? Watch this video to know everything you ever wanted to know about the future of the internet. In simple words, the metaverse is the next generation internet technology that is to improve the current 2D experience, by making it more realistic. How exactly does this happen? It is as simple as wearing a VRS headset. The next milestone of this will be a physical touch experience through the 3D world.

With this, our remote working style is much more likely to revolutionize and not be restricted to the 2D rectangular box. It won't be only restricted to the people of IT & software industry but also factory workers will be able to enjoy the privilege of working from home. With this, the remote working culture will be in boom and thus allowing people from lower opportunity regions to get hired across the world.

Also, the boom of the metaverse is likely to bring in many career opportunities. With the possible evolution of metaverse apps, the demand for metaverse app developers is also likely to be increasing. Following this, the career opportunities for blockchain developers and cyber security engineers are also likely to have a hike. When talking about creating real life in the digital world, the role of a digital artist is inevitable. Data scientists, data analysts, and ML engineers are going to be in huge demand, given the fact that there will be a lot of data created and an ever-growing demand for applying AI and data science on various use cases. Metaverse is going to build a great platform for educational creators, who can then be able to conduct 3D live virtual classes.

However, with the good comes a bad part too. Keep watching this video to know about the possible negative impacts of the metaverse. Note, these are only my point of view. Metaverse is a rising wave and we have to either learn to fight it or surf through it.

Saying YES to go to a non important meeting might mean saying NO to learn a new technology that can advance your career!

Saying YES to binge watch money heist on Netflix == Saying NO for going to a gym or a volleyball game.

Saying YES to spending 5 hours in finding a deal online that saves 50$ == Saying NO to spend some time in setting up a side gig that can make you 50000$ eventually!

We all have a limited time on this earth. Make your choices wisely!

Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Tableau can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

mTVf7BN7S8w,codebasics,"Data augmentation to address overfitting | Deep Learning Tutorial 26 (Tensorflow, Keras & Python)","When we don't have enough training samples to cover diverse cases in image classification, often CNN might overfit. To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning. Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc. In this video, we will classify flower images and see how our cnn model overfits. After that we will use data augmentation to generate new training samples and see how model performance improves.

VxNr9Vudp4Y,codebasics,Shell Sort - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial Python #18,"Shell sort is a customization over insertion sort. Insertion sort requires many swaps and comparisons if heavy elements are located towards the end of an array. Shell sort will initially sort subarrays that are equal distance apart. The distance here is referred to as a gap. We will than keep on reducing the gap until it is 1. With gap=1 it becomes insertion sort but this time due to optimization we have performed earlier, sorting the array would require very less  comparisons and element swaps.

Often interviewers ask questions around quick sort in software engineering interviews. This technique uses divide and conquer approach to divide given list into partitions and then recursively sort these partitions. It starts with a pivot element and tries to put pivot element in its correct position. This video goes over theory and two popular partition schemes called hoare partition and lomuto partition. We will write code to implement quick sort algorithm in python. In the end I have an exercise for you to solve.

We are using 60000 small images for classification. These images can be  classified in one of the 10 categories below,
classes = [""airplane"",""automobile"",""bird"",""cat"",""deer"",""dog"",""frog"",""horse"",""ship"",""truck""]
Here is the dataset link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
We will use simple artificial neural network (we are not using CNN, usually CNN is preferred for image classification but since we have not covered that in our deep learning playlist so far we will be happy with simple ANN that still gives pretty high accuracy).

Tensorboard is a tool that comes with tensorflow and it allows you to visualize neural network as well as how it trains itself. This tool is very helpful in debugging issues too. We will use the notebook that we created in previous videos for recognizing handwritten digits and visualize accuracy,loss with every epoch using tensorboard. We will also look at the visual graphs of neural network along with some internal computations.

Tips for writing clean code: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/TechTopics/CodingBestPractices/coding_best_practices.md
Software architecture blog: https://martinfowler.com/
Competitive coding websites: leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks, careercup

1. Making initial conversation on resume effective
 1.1) Mention only those things on resume that you feel comfortable talking about, for projects that you mentioned on resume you should be able to draw tech arch diagram and talk through various business as well as technical aspects. Like why did you choose given architecture, No SQL vs SQL etc
  - Fresher: college projects
  - Experienced: Projects in past companies
 1.2) Why did you apply in our company? Say you applied in blackhawknetwork, they will ask you ""why blackhawknetwork?"". To respond to this question you need to know about company's products, clients and culture. You can use following resources to gain this knowledge,
  - Company's website, Google
  - Glassdoor
  - Linkedin: Connect with people working in that company 
 1.3) Tell something about yourself
  - Mention your passions any achievements (like opensource contributions, any achievements in projects)

2. Master competitive coding
 2.1) You can use these websites for practice: leetcode, careercup, geeksforgeek, glassdoor
 2.2) Don't make assumptions, ask smart counter questions. They want to check given a vague requirement how can you dig the details and transition from vague to concrete
 2.3) Data structure: Same problem can be solved using two different data structure but one DS might be more efficient than others
 2.4) Clean and effective coding
  - proper variable, class names 
  - modularize code using functions,classes
  - compact coding (use code review guidelines github page)
 
3. Mastering questions related to data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, design
 3.1) Again refer to glassdoor, careercup, leetcode for questions
 3.2) Experienced programmer: design questions 
  - Design messenger
  - Design facebook
  - This will cover things such as overall system design, databases, caching, scalability, class design, distributed computing
 
4. Communication, confidence and body language
 4.1) Be confident, don't have a guilt if you answer something wrong
 4.2) If you don't know about some topic be honest and say I've not worked on Redis but I know about cache little bit and I am ready to learn

5. Asking smart questions on the role and the company
 - What tech stack do you use in your team and in the company in general?
 - What type of problems your company or your team solves? 
 - What are growth and learning opportunities?
 - Will I get a chance to contribute to open source?
 - Which team you are working on and do you enjoy working here and why?
 - What are some of the good aspects of working here?

Now just a disclaimer, in order to learn deep learning you don't need to have such an expensive setup. Whatever laptop or personal computer you have should still work ok. If you have a requirements for running heavy jobs, you can utilize cloud for that. For me, NVIDIA gave 2500$ Titan RTX GPU for free and than I spent close to 1000$ for other parts to build this PC. My plan is to run some heavy deep learning jobs on this computer and I will be making videos on that in future.

PQCE9ChuIDY,codebasics,"Implement Neural Network In Python | Deep Learning Tutorial 13 (Tensorflow2.0, Keras & Python)","In this video we will implement a simple neural network with single neuron from scratch in python. This is also an implementation of a logistic regression in python from scratch. You know that logistic regression can be thought of as a simple neural network. The pre requisite for this tutorial is the previous tutorial on gradient descent (link below). We will be using gradient descent python funciton written in previous video to implement our own custom neural network class.

We will go over various loss functions in this video such as mean absolute error (a.k.a MAE), mean squared error (a.k.a MSE), log loss or binary cross entropy. After going through theory we will implement these loss functions in python. It is important to go through this implementation as it might be useful during your interviews (if you are targeting a role of a data scientist or a machine learning engineer)

We will use insurance dataset as a sample and build a logistic regression. Logistic regression uses two step process for classification,
step 1: linear regression to find best fit line for given dataset
step 2: sigmoid or logit function to convert this line into values between 0 and 1
Using sigmoid function one can do a classification.

yfsTZbwgMSE,codebasics,"Why deep learning is becoming so popular? | Deep Learning Tutorial 2 (Tensorflow2.0, Keras & Python)","This video explains four reasons why deep learning has become so popular in past few years.
In this deep learning tutorial python, I will cover following things in this video,
00:00 Introduction 
00:24 Data growth
01:25 Hardware advancements
02:40 Python and opensource ecosystem
04:00 Cloud and AI boom

I remember I did a project in my college 17 years ago and implemented error backpropogation algorithm in C++. Why is it that deep learning is taking off in recent years? The data growth due to IT adoption, IOT devices, social media is generating so much truth so that deep learning algorithms can really produce useful results. Neural network and deep learning shows its real power when training data size is huge. Due to advancements in hardwares such as GPU and TPUs one can run so many computations in parallel making it possible to run deep learning training in a reasonable amount of time. Python and opensource ecosystem on the other hand reduced the barries for people who don't know programming and they can  try python with pytorch or tensorflow and write deep learning programs easily. One doesn't need to buy expensive hardware, they can rent a machine in a cloud and can still write machine learning programs. There is a prevalent AI boom in the businesses nowadays where all business executives want to benefit from artificial intelligence. This further accelerates the growth of deep learning.

1) What questions or insights this report is generating for you? For example revenues from Electricsara stores client are declining. So may be we need to engage more with this client and try to figure out a way to increase our sales (may be give them special discount)
2) Say you are a sales director of Atliq hardware and now you started using this dashboard. What improvements you want to make in this? For example I want to see pie chart of revenues from top 5 clients. 
We will have next 5 days to collect this feedback (till 2nd July). I will invite Hemanand (a data analyst manager working for a company in UK) and we both will address the feedback and improvise the dashboard.

9QiZ0-HZG_A,codebasics,Sales Insights Data Analysis Project In Power BI - Part 2 - Data Discovery,"In this video we will cover project planning and data discovery aspect of our sales insights data analysis project. Once sales directory of atliQ hardware has decided to invest in data analysis project he will do a meeting with IT director, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They will use AIMS grid to define purpose and success criteria of this project. 

AIMS grid simple explanation:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6118I9HViuQ

Once AIMS grid is defined, next step is data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approaches IT team within an organization who owns software system that keep track of sales records. These records are stored in mysql database. Power BI can be plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. I also discuss ETL, OLTP, OLAP and data warehouse concepts. Many times we need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in our project we will directly use mysql database.

xucm6_BQPJU,codebasics,Artificial Intelligence (AI) vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning vs Data Science,"Artificial intelligence is a field where set of techniques are used to make computers as smart as humans. There are certain tasks where human outperform computers such as image recognition, cognitive thinking, creativity, driving cars etc. Machine learning is a sub domain of artificial intelligence where set of statistical and neural network based algorithms are used for training a computer in doing a smart task. Deep learning is all about neural networks. Deep learning is considered to be a sub field of machine learning. Pytorch and Tensorflow are two popular frameworks that can be used in doing deep learning. 
Data science on the other hand a field where data is used to generate business insights. It can use machine learning techniques but data science can be done without using machine learning as well. One can use Microsoft excel to draw insights from data. Visualization and BI tools such as tableau and power BI can be used to plot powerful business reports that can give lots of insights about a business.

We will then use GridSearchCV and try different models with different hyper parameters to come up with a best model that can give us maximum accuracy. We will use sklearn classification_report to check the performance. Once we select best model based on GridSearchCV we can evaluate it on X_test and y_test to get a feel of how it is going to perform in production. Confusion matrix is used with seaborn visualization to get an understanding of classification errors for each of the classes. In the end we export the model to a file using joblib.

kwKfWBb6frs,codebasics,Data Science & Machine Learning Project - Part 3 Data Cleaning | Image Classification,"In this video, we are going to clean images that we downloaded from google in a way that it is suitable to train our classifier. We mostly identify a person in a photo with a face. Hence we will use opencv and a technique called haar cascades to detect if a face and two eyes are clearly visible or not. If they are than we keep the image otherwise we discard the image. Majority of the data cleaning work will be done using python code but there will be some cleaning work that we will have to do manually.

pOXmn7jP9gQ,codebasics,Is Becoming a Data Scientist Hard?,"HBR named data scientist the sexiest job of the 21st century. If companies are paying so high for data scientist jobs, it must be not very easy to become a data scientist. However many times people live in inferiority complex thinking that they are not good at math, statistics, or programming hence they can't become data scientist even though they have a passion in this field. My suggestion is to ask yourself ""have you followed the right resources to learn data science skills?"" For example, to learn math I always advise people to use these resources,
Great resources to learn math:
https://www.mathsisfun.com/
https://www.khanacademy.org/
3b1b youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw

Also for python programming, this tutorial playlist is something that even middle school student can follow along easily,
Python tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

Other than following the right resources one needs to ask if you are right-brained or left-brained person. Are you interested in data science and analytical job? Data scientist job is so much in demand and there is a lot of competition so certainly, while it is not easy to become a data scientist if you are committed and ready to do hard work with a lot of discipline it is certainly not very hard as well.

A3gClkblXK8,codebasics,Outlier detection and removal using IQR | Feature engineering tutorial python # 4,"IQR is another technique that one can use to detect and remove outliers. The formula for IQR is very simple. IQR = Q3-Q1. Where Q3 is 75th percentile and Q1 is 25th percentile. Once you have IQR you can find upper and lower limit by removing this formula,
lower_limit = Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_limit = Q3 +1.5*IQR
Anything less than a lower limit or above the upper limit is considered outlier. We will use python pandas to remove outliers on a sample dataset and in the end, as usual, I have an interesting exercise for you to practice

Many times these are legitimate values and it really depends on the situation if you want to remove them or not.

They are useful in implementing set/map class in different programming languages. They provide efficient way of search an element in log n complexity. There are various traversal schemes you can use such as breadth first search and depth first search. In depth first search you can use in order traversal, pre order traversal and post order traversal schemes that will benefit in different scenarious. For example  in order traversal gives you a sorted list of elements in a tree. After going through theory we will implement binary tree, rather binary search tree in python. Binary search tree is also known as BST that is basically a binary tree with some order of elements.

qp8u-frRAnU,codebasics,Linked List - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorials in Python #4,"Linked list is a data structure similar to array in a sense that it stores bunch of items. But unlike array, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations. They are instead chained by an element storing address location of next element. This makes insertion very easy. Also unlike dynamic arrays you don't have to pre-allocate some memory capacity. In this tutorial we will go through some theory first and then write python code to implement linked list. In the end we have an interesting exercise for you to solve.

_t2GVaQasRY,codebasics,Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial in Python #1 - What are data structures?,"Data structures are basic building blocks of any software program. One can not become a good programmer without a sound understanding of data structures. This is the reason, interviewers ask data structure questions in any programming interview. They store data in a specific memory layout and based on what type of problem you are solving it might become necessary to use one data structure versus the other. The few most common data structures are array, linked list, tree, stack, queue, etc. In this video, we will understand what data structures are and their implementations in different programming languages.

IR_S8BC8KI0,codebasics,Big O notation - Data Structures & Algorithms Tutorial #2 | Measuring time complexity,"Big O notation is the way to measure how software program's running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. We can't measure this using absolute terms such as time in seconds because different computers have different hardware hence we need a mathematical way to measure time complexity of a program and Big O is that mathematical way. The basic idea is to come up with mathematical function for a running time and consider only fastest growing term and discard other terms as well as constants. Big O is used to measure space complexity as well, You will know how to find the time and space complexity of algorithms.

Clarification: At 5:05, the code should be print(str(numbers[i]) + "" is a duplicate""), to concatenate integer with string you need to convert to string or use format string.

q9oAZwhuUy4,codebasics,Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist,"Want to know the difference between Data Analyst vs Data Engineer vs Data Scientist? Keep watching this video to know. Data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer are three different roles in the field of data science and data analytics. And these three roles can sometimes confuse data science aspirants. 
A data engineer is a software engineer who specializes in data-based technology and is well versed in extracting data from structured and unstructured sources. A data analyst is a person who has domain knowledge, while the data scientist has all the skillset like an analyst, but is also good at statistics and knows deep learning, machine learning, and natural language processing. The difference between data analyst vs data scientist, is the expertise in statics. 
A short summary of the difference is that a data engineer is like a raw material you need to prepare any dish, while the data scientist or analyst is the chef who can make the dish.

cbqZa_1vzcg,codebasics,Machine Learning & Data Science Project - 4 : Outlier Removal (Real Estate Price Prediction Project),"This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Matplotlib for data visualization
4) Sklearn for model building
5) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6) Python flask for http server
7) HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

In this particular video we will load banglore home prices data into pandas dataframe and than handle NA values. We will than removal some unnecessary features and also normalize property size. We will convert the range of property size (such as 2100-3250) into an average of min and max.

Step by step approach on learning data science is,

1) Pick a data science project first: you can use kaggle.com datasets or competitions for this. 

2) Learn either python or R programming language. For python you can follow this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eykoKxsYtow&list=PLeo1K3hjS3usILfyvQlvUBokXkHPSve6S

3) Once you have basic understanding of python, you need to learn data exploration and data cleaning using pandas. Here is the playlist for pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmorAWRsCAw&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy

4) Jupyter notebook is an essential tool that you can use as a code editor. Here is the tutorial on notebook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEEZX_0FMEc

5) matplotlib is widely used for data visualization and for that also I've a playlist of tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqwf4Vuj8oM&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu4Lr8_kro2AqaO6CFYgKOl

6) Once data cleaning and exploration is over, next step is to build machine learning model. For statistical models we can use sklearn library and for deep learning we can use pytorch and google's tensorflow. For machine learning I've created very easy to follow tutorial list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmvvaobm7eQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw

JL_grPUnXzY,codebasics,What is Data Science? | Free Data Science Course | Data Science for Beginners | codebasics,"We will understand what is data science by looking at simple restaurant business example. Data science is a process of getting insights from data. You don't have to be deep learning expert in order to do data science, you can do that in plain old microsoft excel also (if dataset is small enough). In recent years volume of data has grown too much so that data has become BIG DATA. Microsoft excel can't work with big data hence you need tools such as,

#DataScience #WhatIsDataScience #DataScienceForBeginners #DataScientist #DataScienceTutorial #DataScienceWithPython #DataScienceCourse

1) Apache hadoop and apache spark: For database storage and distributed computing
2) Python and R: For data science programming
3) Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, MATLAB, Jupyter Notebook: For data visualization
4) Sklearn, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, PyTorch: For deep learning and machine learning

Data scientist has become the most popular job in the market today and there is a huge career scope if you know how to do data science. Some of the use cases of data science in real life are,

1) Healthcare: Diagnostic prediction and accuracy
2) Finance: Fraud detection, predictive analysis on loans, stock market movement, company future
3) Shipping: Figure out best route for shipping 
4) E-commerce: Product recommendation, inventory pricing

HdlDYng8g9s,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 16: Hyper parameter Tuning (GridSearchCV),"In this python machine learning tutorial for beginners we will look into,
1) how to hyper tune machine learning model paramers 
2) choose best model for given machine learning problem
We will start by comparing traditional train_test_split approach with k fold cross validation. Then we will see how GridSearchCV helps run K Fold cross validation with its convenient api. GridSearchCV helps find best parameters that gives maximum performance. RandomizedSearchCV is another class in sklearn library that does same thing as GridSearchCV
but without running exhaustive search, this helps with computation time and resources. We will also see how to find best model among all the classification algorithm using GridSearchCV. In the end we have interesting exercise for you to solve.

zyib_6XZW0g,codebasics,Drinking Raw Goat Milk In India,"I'm on a trip to India and here I've had some unique experiences including drinking raw (non pasteurized) goat milk. It has several health benefits. It restores gut flora and creates a balance between good and bad bacteria. Drinking this milk was suggested as a remedy for my chronic health condition and I wanted to try it out while I am in my village.
My village's name is Narsanda in the state of gujarat, India. This is where I was born and raised, my family still lives here.

9yl6-HEY7_s,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 6: Dummy Variables & One Hot Encoding,"Machine learning models work very well for dataset having only numbers. But how do we handle text information in dataset? Simple approach is to use interger or label encoding but when categorical variables are nominal, using simple label encoding can be problematic. One hot encoding is the technique that can help in this situation. In this tutorial, we will use pandas get_dummies method to create dummy variables that allows us to perform one hot encoding on given dataset. Alternatively we can use sklearn.preprocessing OneHotEncoder as well to create dummy variables.

KfnhNlD8WZI,codebasics,Machine Learning Tutorial Python - 5: Save Model Using Joblib And Pickle,"Training machine learning model can be quite time consuming if training dataset is very big. In this case it makes sense to train a model and save it to a file so that later on while making predictions you can just load that model from a file and you don't need to train it every time. Pickle and sklearn joblib modules can be used for this purpose. Joblib seems to be more efficient with big numpy arrays hence it is preferred when you have many numpy objects involved in your training step.

eykoKxsYtow,codebasics,Why Should You Learn Python? | Complete python3 tutorials for beginners,"Python tutorial for beginners: In this tutorial we will learn why everyone should learn python. If you are a beginner and just starting out with programming then python is probably the best place to start. Also for experienced programmers, it makes sense to learn python programming because code development speed is very good and one can to fast prototyping. Python is used heavily in data science, machine learning, scientific computing due to its rich set of libraries (modules). So come and learn python with me :)

Topics that are covered in this Video:
0:00 Introduction 
0:08 It is easy to learn and very intuitive programming language
1:02 You can develop code really fast in python whereas with other languages it takes relatively longer time. This is so because,
   * The code syntax is compact
   * There is no compilation. Python is interpreted language so you save time on compiling the code.
   * It has rich set of libraries so for pretty much anything you can just import a library, write couple of lines using that and you are done
2:45 Rich set of libraries or modules
3:24 Used heavily in the fields of data science, machine learning and scientific computing
3:52 Plenty of job opportunities
