# Exploratory Data Analysing My Favorite Data Science Channels Using Youtube API

YouTube can be a rich educational resource. I personally use it a lot and learned a lot from it. In this project, I decided to analyze 4 of my favorite YouTube channels ([codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=codebasics),[Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/user/krishnaik06),[Ken Jee](https://www.youtube.com/c/KenJee1),[Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/c/sentdex)) in the field of data science and machine learning and related and get to know them better.These channels have a large number of subscribers and have good performance and different types of audience and followers, so this analysis can be useful for those who want to work in the field of data science education on YouTube.

Tip - The visualizations and analyzes used in this project can be used to analyze any channel, just extract the desired channel data.

In this project, I will cover and explore the following:

- ### Extract Data from Youtube API .
- ### Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- ### Analyzing (channel,videos,comments) data and analyze and compare their performance and see what made them popular, for example :
    - How many subscribers they have and how far are they from each other ?
    - Which one has uploaded more videos ?
    - Comparison of the number of views of each channel
    - How long did it take to reach their current position ?
    - The most viewed video of each channel
    - How long are the videos usually?
    - What day do they usually upload videos ?
    - In which year did Chanel perform better ?
    - Whats average duration of videos 

    - check correlation
        - Dose video durition matter for views ?
        - Does title length matter for views ? 
        - Does likesCount and commentsCount correlated with views ?  
    
- ### Explore text data using NLP techniques
        - Most written in the comments for each channel
        - Most words used in titles
        - Sentiment analysis for the comments of each channel
